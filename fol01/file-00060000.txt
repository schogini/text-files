 Here's a comfortable chair you can sit in.
 If you are tied up now, I'll call you back later on.
 I want to know what you did this summer.
 It seems hard for you to see him today.
 What you have just said reminds me of an old saying.
 If you leave now, I'm sure you'll be caught in a traffic jam.
 What is it that you want me to do now?
 Who has made you what you are now?
 I'll miss you when you're gone.
 It makes no difference to me whether you go or not.
 It's all the same to me whether you go or stay.
