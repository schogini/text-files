During my school-days I had been intimately associated with a lad named Percy Phelps, who was of much the same age as myself, though he was two classes ahead of me.
He was a very brilliant boy, and carried away every prize which the school had to offer, finished his exploits by winning a scholarship which sent him on to continue his triumphant career at Cambridge.
Every minute seems an hour while I live in this state of horrible suspense.
There was something that touched me as I read this letter.
Holmes was seated at his side-table clad in his dressing-gown, and working hard over a chemical investigation.
A large curved retort was boiling furiously in the bluish flame of a Bunsen burner, and the distilled drops were condensing into a two-litre measure.
My friend hardly glanced up as I entered.
He dipped into this bottle or that, drawing out a few drops of each with his glass pipette, and finally brought a test-tube containing a solution over to the table. In his right hand he held a slip of litmus-paper.
"You come at a crisis, Watson," said he. "If this paper remains blue, all is well. If it turns red, it means a man's life." He dipped it into the test-tube and it flushed at once into a dull, dirty crimson.
Holmes turned to his desk and scribbled off several telegrams, which were handed over to the page-boy.
On sending in our cards we were shown into an elegantly appointed drawing-room, where we were joined in a few minutes by a rather stout man who received us with much hospitality.
His age may have been nearer forty than thirty, but his cheeks were so ruddy and his eyes so merry that he still conveyed the impression of a plump and mischievous boy.
"I am so glad that you have come," said he, shaking our hands with effusion.
Percy has been inquiring for you all morning.
Percy is to marry my sister Annie.
A young man, very pale and worn, was lying upon a sofa near the open window, through which came the rich scent of the garden and the balmy summer air.
A woman was sitting beside him, who rose as we entered.
"Shall I leave, Percy?" she asked. He clutched her hand to detain her.
"How are you, Watson?" said he, cordially. "I should never have known you under that moustache."
This I presume is your celebrated friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes
She was a striking-looking woman, a little short and thick for symmetry, but with a beautiful olive complexion, large, dark, Italian eyes, and a wealth of deep black hair.
She was a striking-looking woman, with a beautiful olive complexion, large, dark, Italian eyes, and a wealth of deep black hair.
Her rich tints made the white face of her companion the more worn and haggard by the contrast.
"I won't waste your time," said he, raising himself upon the sofa.
I'll plunge into the matter without further preamble.
I was a happy and successful man, Mr. Holmes, and on the eve of being married, when a sudden and dreadful misfortune wrecked all my prospects in life.
The July which immediately succeeded my marriage was made memorable by three cases of interest.
"This," said he, taking a grey roll of paper from his bureau, "is the original of that secret treaty between England and Italy."
The French or the Russian embassy would pay an immense sum to learn the contents of these papers.
A cup of coffee would clear my brain.
I went down the stairs and into the hall, where I found the commissionnaire fast asleep in his box, with the kettle boiling furiously upon the spirit-lamp. I took off the kettle and blew out the lamp, for the water was spurting over the floor.
The night was very dark, and a thin, warm rain was falling.
We rushed along the pavement, bare-headed as we were, and at the far corner we found a policeman standing.
"A robbery has been committed," I gasped. "A document of immense value has been stolen from the Foreign Office. Has any one passed this way?'"
"'I have been standing here for a quarter of an hour, sir,' said he; 'only one person has passed during that time—a woman, tall and elderly, with a Paisley shawl.'
Tom found God in prison.
You know where you find me if you need me.
Which way did the woman go?
She seemed to be in a hurry.
There was absolutely no clue of any kind.
She stared at us with defiant eyes.
Watson there would tell you that I was a nervous, sensitive boy at school. It is my nature.
No allowance is made for accidents where diplomatic interests are at stake. I was ruined, shamefully, hopelessly ruined.
If it had not been for Miss Harrison here and for the doctor's care I should not be speaking to you now. She has nursed me by day and a hired nurse has looked after me by night, for in my mad fits I was capable of anything.
Slowly my reason has cleared, but it is only during the last three days that my memory has quite returned. Sometimes I wish that it never had.
I turn to you, Mr. Holmes, as absolutely my last hope. If you fail me, then my honour as well as my position are forever forfeited.
The invalid sank back upon his cushions, tired out by this long recital, while his nurse poured him out a glass of some stimulating medicine.
Holmes sat silently, with his head thrown back and his eyes closed.
Holmes sat silently, with his head thrown back and his eyes closed, in an attitude which might seem listless to a stranger, but which I knew betokened the most intense self-absorption.
The authorities are excellent at amassing facts, though they do not always use them to advantage.
What a lovely thing a rose is!
Holmes walked past the couch to the open window, and held up the drooping stalk of a moss-rose, looking down at the dainty blend of crimson and green. It was a new phase of his character to me, for I had never before seen him show any keen interest in natural objects.
Our highest assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to rest in the flowers. All other things, our powers, our desires, our food, are all really necessary for our existence in the first instance. But this rose is an extra. Its smell and its colour are an embellishment of life, not a condition of it.
He had fallen into a reverie, with the rose between his fingers.
"Do you see any prospect of solving this mystery, Mr. Holmes?" she asked, with a touch of asperity in her voice.
Do you see any prospect of solving this mystery, Mr. Holmes?
Look at those big, isolated clumps of building rising up above the slates, like brick islands in a lead-coloured sea.
"Look at those big, isolated clumps of building rising up above the slates, like brick islands in a lead-coloured sea." "The board-schools." "Light-houses, my boy! Beacons of the future! Capsules with hundreds of bright little seeds in each, out of which will spring the wise, better England of the future."
The most difficult crime to track is the one which is purposeless.
I sent wires from Woking station to every evening paper in London. This advertisement will appear in each of them.
"I've heard of your methods before now, Mr. Holmes," said he, tartly. "You are ready enough to use all the information that the police can lay at your disposal, and then you try to finish the case yourself and bring discredit on them."
"On the contrary," said Holmes, "out of my last fifty-three cases my name has only appeared in four, and the police have had all the credit in forty-nine. I don't blame you for not knowing this, for you are young and inexperienced, but if you wish to get on in your new duties you will work with me and not against me."
I don't blame you for not knowing this, for you are young and inexperienced.
I don't blame you for not knowing this.
"Where are we going to now?" I asked, as we left the office. "We are now going to interview Lord Holdhurst, the cabinet minister and future premier of England."
We were fortunate in finding that Lord Holdhurst was still in his chambers in Downing Street, and on Holmes sending in his card we were instantly shown up.
The statesman received us with that old-fashioned courtesy for which he is remarkable.
With his slight, tall figure, his sharp features, thoughtful face, and curling hair prematurely tinged with grey, he seemed to represent that not too common type, a nobleman who is in truth noble.
"Your name is very familiar to me, Mr. Holmes," said he, smiling.
I cannot pretend to be ignorant of the object of your visit.
In whose interest are you acting, may I ask?
I had one or two questions which I wished to ask you.
And now, Lord Holdhurst, we have already taken up too much of your valuable time, and we shall wish you good-day.
His conversation, I remember, was about the Bertillon system of measurements, and he expressed his enthusiastic admiration of the French savant.
We found our client still under the charge of his devoted nurse, but looking considerably better than before.
He rose from the sofa and greeted us without difficulty when we entered.
"Any news?" he asked, eagerly.
His expression grew very grave as he spoke, and a look of something akin to fear sprang up in his eyes.
I begin to believe that I am the unconscious centre of some monstrous conspiracy, and that my life is aimed at as well as my honour.
I had sunk into a light sleep when I was suddenly aroused by a slight noise.
I was suddenly aroused by a slight noise. It was like the sound which a mouse makes when it is gnawing a plank.
Then I heard a gentle creaking as the window was very slowly opened.
My nerves are not what they used to be.
I sprang out of bed and flung open the shutters.
A man was crouching at the window. I could see little of him, for he was gone like a flash. He was wrapped in some sort of cloak which came across the lower part of his face. One thing only I am sure of, and that is that he had some weapon in his hand. It looked to me like a long knife. I distinctly saw the gleam of it as he turned to run.
"This is most interesting," said Holmes.
I rang the bell and roused the house.
This tale of our client's appeared to have an extraordinary effect upon Sherlock Holmes. He rose from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable excitement.
Misfortunes never come single.
I should like a little sunshine.
"Miss Harrison," said Holmes, speaking with the utmost intensity of manner, "you must stay where you are all day. Let nothing prevent you from staying where you are all day. It is of the utmost importance." "Certainly, if you wish it, Mr. Holmes," said the girl in astonishment.
"Why do you sit moping there, Annie?" cried her brother. "Come out into the sunshine!"
"Why do you sit moping there, Annie?" cried her brother. "Come out into the sunshine!" "No, thank you, Joseph. I have a slight headache and this room is deliciously cool and soothing."
I believe there is some deep political intrigue going on around me, and that for some reason that passes my understanding my life is aimed at by the conspirators.
It'll get better.
She loves you.
Why should a thief try to break in at a bedroom window, where there could be no hope of any plunder, and why should he come with a long knife in his hand?
You are sure it was not a house-breaker's jimmy?
It was a knife. I saw the flash of the blade quite distinctly.
Tom was still weak after his long illness.
Holmes strolled round the house with his hands in his pockets and a negligent air.
To my certain knowledge he has acted on behalf of three of the reigning houses of Europe in very vital matters.
Standing in the window we saw that his left hand was swathed in a bandage and that his face was very grim and pale.
This case of yours, Mr. Phelps, is certainly one of the darkest which I have ever investigated.
"Won't you tell us what has happened?" "After breakfast, my dear Watson."
"God bless you!" he cried. "You have saved my honour."
"God bless you!" he cried. "You have saved my honour." "Well, my own was at stake, you know," said Holmes. "I assure you it is just as hateful to me to fail in a case as it can be to you to blunder over a commission."
Phelps thrust away the precious document into the innermost pocket of his coat.
Sherlock Holmes swallowed a cup of coffee, and turned his attention to the ham and eggs. Then he rose, lit his pipe, and settled himself down into his chair.
After leaving you at the station I went for a charming walk through some admirable Surrey scenery to a pretty little village called Ripley, where I had my tea at an inn.
I can't accept this situation.
"My God!" gasped our client. "Do you tell me that during these long ten weeks of agony the stolen papers were within the very room with me all the time?" "So it was."
He has lost heavily in dabbling with stocks.
Percy Phelps sank back in his chair. "My head whirls," said he. "Your words have dazed me."
"The principal difficulty in your case," remarked Holmes, in his didactic fashion, "lay in the fact of there being too much evidence."
What was vital was overlaid and hidden by what was irrelevant.
I think he accepted himself.
You are missing the point.

What does Tom need from us?
Question everything.
I've had something on my conscience for a long time.
It is with a heavy heart that I take up my pen to write these the last words in which I shall ever record the singular gifts by which my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes was distinguished.
I alone know the absolute truth of the matter, and I am satisfied that the time has come when no good purpose is to be served by its suppression.
It lies with me to tell for the first time what really took place between Professor Moriarty and Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
It may be remembered that after my marriage, and my subsequent start in private practice, the very intimate relations which had existed between Holmes and myself became to some extent modified.
He still came to me from time to time when he desired a companion in his investigation, but these occasions grew more and more seldom.
I saw in the papers that he had been engaged by the French government upon a matter of supreme importance, and I received two notes from Holmes, dated from Narbonne and from Nimes, from which I gathered that his stay in France was likely to be a long one.
It was with some surprise, therefore, that I saw him walk into my consulting-room upon the evening of April 24th.
It struck me that he was looking even paler and thinner than usual.
He was looking even paler and thinner than usual.
I have been a little pressed of late.
Have you any objection to my closing your shutters?
The only light in the room came from the lamp upon the table at which I had been reading.
Holmes edged his way round the wall and flinging the shutters together, he bolted them securely.
"You are afraid of something?" I asked.
I think that you know me well enough, Watson, to understand that I am by no means a nervous man. At the same time, it is stupidity rather than courage to refuse to recognise danger when it is close upon you.
"I must apologise for calling so late," said he, "and I must further beg you to be so unconventional as to allow me to leave your house presently by scrambling over your back garden wall."
He held out his hand, and I saw in the light of the lamp that two of his knuckles were burst and bleeding.
Is Mrs. Watson in?
"You have probably never heard of Professor Moriarty?" said he. "Never."
But I could not rest, Watson, I could not sit quiet in my chair, if I thought that such a man as Professor Moriarty were walking the streets of London unchallenged.
I tell you, Watson, in all seriousness, that if I could beat that man, if I could free society of him, I should feel that my own career had reached its summit, and I should be prepared to turn to some more placid line in life.
His career has been an extraordinary one.
He is a man of good birth and excellent education, endowed by nature with a phenomenal mathematical faculty.
At the age of twenty-one he wrote a treatise upon the Binomial Theorem, which has had a European vogue.
But the man had hereditary tendencies of the most diabolical kind. A criminal strain ran in his blood, which, instead of being modified, was increased and rendered infinitely more dangerous by his extraordinary mental powers.
Dark rumours gathered round him in the university town, and eventually he was compelled to resign his chair and to come down to London.
As you are aware, Watson, there is no one who knows the higher criminal world of London so well as I do.
For years past I have continually been conscious of some power behind the malefactor, some deep organising power which forever stands in the way of the law.
Again and again in cases of the most varying sorts—forgery cases, robberies, murders—I have felt the presence of this force, and I have deduced its action in many of those undiscovered crimes in which I have not been personally consulted.
For years past I have continually been conscious of some power behind the malefactor, some deep organising power which forever stands in the way of the law, and throws its shield over the wrong-doer. Again and again in cases of the most varying sorts--forgery cases, robberies, murders--I have felt the presence of this force, and I have deduced its action in many of those undiscovered crimes in which I have not been personally consulted. For years I have endeavoured to break through the veil which shrouded it, and at last the time came when I seized my thread and followed it, until it led me, after a thousand cunning windings, to ex-Professor Moriarty of mathematical celebrity.
He is the Napoleon of crime, Watson.
He is the organiser of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city.
He is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract thinker.
He has a brain of the first order.
He sits motionless, like a spider in the centre of its web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well every quiver of each of them.
He does little himself. He only plans. But his agents are numerous and splendidly organised.
The agent may be caught. In that case money is found for his bail or his defence. But the central power which uses the agent is never caught—never so much as suspected.
This was the organisation which I deduced, Watson, and which I devoted my whole energy to exposing and breaking up.
But the Professor was fenced round with safeguards so cunningly devised that, do what I would, it seemed impossible to get evidence which would convict in a court of law.
You know my powers, my dear Watson, and yet at the end of three months I was forced to confess that I had at last met an antagonist who was my intellectual equal.
My horror at his crimes was lost in my admiration at his skill.
In three days—that is to say, on Monday next—matters will be ripe, and the Professor, with all the principal members of his gang, will be in the hands of the police.
Then will come the greatest criminal trial of the century, the clearing up of over forty mysteries, and the rope for all of them.
Never have I been so hard pressed by an opponent.
I was sitting in my room thinking the matter over, when the door opened and Professor Moriarty stood before me.
My nerves are fairly proof, Watson, but I must confess to a start when I saw the very man who had been so much in my thoughts standing there on my threshold.
He is extremely tall and thin, his forehead domes out in a white curve, and his two eyes are deeply sunken in this head.
He is clean-shaven, pale, and ascetic-looking, retaining something of the professor in his features.
His shoulders are rounded from much study, and his face protrudes forward, and is forever slowly oscillating from side to side in a curiously reptilian fashion.
He peered at me with great curiosity in his puckered eyes.
It is a dangerous habit to finger loaded firearms in the pocket of one's dressing-gown.
"Danger is part of my trade," I remarked.
You must stand clear, Mr. Holmes, or be trodden under foot.
"I am afraid," said I, rising, "that in the pleasure of this conversation I am neglecting business of importance which awaits me elsewhere."
He rose also and looked at me in silence, shaking his head sadly.
I know every move of your game.
It has been a duel between you and me, Mr. Holmes.
You hope to beat me. I tell you that you will never beat me.
If you are clever enough to bring destruction upon me, rest assured that I shall do as much to you.
Professor Moriarty is not a man who lets the grass grow under his feet.
As I walked down Vere Street a brick came down from the roof of one of the houses, and was shattered to fragments at my feet.
Then these are your instructions, and I beg, my dear Watson, that you will obey them to the letter, for you are now playing a double-handed game with me against the cleverest rogue and the most powerful syndicate of criminals in Europe.
Let me ask you a question, Tom.
Please keep my secret.
Please keep my secret!
My father would never approve.
My father would never approve of our marriage.
Mary suddenly realized her state of undress.
Tom suddenly realized his state of undress.
Tom's eyes gradually became accustomed to the darkness.
Aren't you going to introduce me to your date?
"What did you tell him?" "The truth."
"What did you tell her?" "The truth."
Does he know the way?
"What did you tell Tom?" "I told him the truth."
How much do I owe her?
Tom pulled back the covers.
"Does he love you?" "I don't know."
"Does she love you?" "I don't know."
Go and have fun.
How is married life?
They'll be playing soccer tomorrow.

It's not the destination that matters, but the journey.
The journey, Not the destination matters...
I was wrong to lie to you.
It was in vain that I asked Holmes to remain for the evening.
So far all had gone admirably.
My luggage was waiting for me.
Tom's luggage was waiting for him at the hotel.
Glancing back, I saw a tall man pushing his way furiously through the crowd, and waving his hand as if he desired to have the train stopped.
Have you seen the morning paper, Watson?
There are limits, you see, to our friend's intelligence.
Tatoeba isn't big enough for the both of us.
Boston isn't big enough for the both of us.
"I might have known it!" he groaned. "He has escaped!" "Moriarty?" "They have secured the whole gang with the exception of him. He has given them the slip."
We sat in the Strasbourg salle-à-manger arguing the question for half an hour.
For a charming week we wandered up the Valley of the Rhone, and then, branching off at Leuk, we made our way over the Gemmi Pass, still deep in snow, and so, by way of Interlaken, to Meiringen.
It was a lovely trip.
It was a lovely trip, the dainty green of the spring below, the virgin white of the winter above; but it was clear to me that never for one instant did Holmes forget the shadow which lay across him.
A large rock which had been dislodged from the ridge upon our right clattered down and roared into the lake behind us.
In an instant Holmes raced up on to the ridge, and, standing upon a lofty pinnacle, craned his neck in every direction.
Tom craned his neck in every direction.
The squirrel climbed on the rock and craned its neck in every direction.
It is indeed, a fearful place. The torrent, swollen by the melting snow, plunges into a tremendous abyss, from which the spray rolls up like the smoke from a burning house.
It was impossible to refuse the request of a fellow-countrywoman dying in a strange land.
As I turned away I saw Holmes, with his back against a rock and his arms folded, gazing down at the rush of the waters.
It was the last that I was ever destined to see of him in this world.
A look of surprise passed over his face.
"You did not write this?" I said, pulling the letter from my pocket.
"You did not write this?" I said, pulling the letter from my pocket. "There is no sick Englishwoman in the hotel?" "Certainly not!" he cried.
But there was no sign of him, and it was in vain that I shouted.
It was supposed to be a relaxing vacation.
I couldn't ask for anything more.
I stood for a minute or two to collect myself.
Any attempt at recovering the bodies was absolutely hopeless, and there, deep down in that dreadful caldron of swirling water and seething foam, will lie for all time the most dangerous criminal and the foremost champion of the law of their generation.
The Swiss youth was never found again.

On the table lay two banknotes for ten pounds each and seventeen pounds ten in silver and gold, the money arranged in little piles of varying amount.
All day I turned these facts over in my mind.
I had not been in my study five minutes when the maid entered to say that a person desired to see me.
I had not been in my study five minutes when the maid entered to say that a person desired to see me. To my astonishment it was none other than my strange old book collector, his sharp, wizened face peering out from a frame of white hair, and his precious volumes, a dozen of them at least, wedged under his right arm.
I moved my head to look at the cabinet behind me. When I turned again, Sherlock Holmes was standing smiling at me across my study table.
I rose to my feet, stared at him for some seconds in utter amazement, and then it appears that I must have fainted for the first and the last time in my life.
“My dear Watson,” said the well-remembered voice, “I owe you a thousand apologies. I had no idea that you would be so affected.”
I gripped him by the arms. “Holmes!” I cried. “Is it really you? Can it indeed be that you are alive? Is it possible that you succeeded in climbing out of that awful abyss?”
Good Heavens!
Again I gripped him by the sleeve, and felt the thin, sinewy arm beneath it. “Well, you're not a spirit, anyhow,” said I.
My dear chap, I'm overjoyed to see you.
Sit down, and tell me how you came alive out of that dreadful chasm.
He sat opposite to me.
Holmes looked even thinner and keener than of old, but there was a dead-white tinge in his aquiline face which told me that his life recently had not been a healthy one.
“You’ll come with me tonight?” “When you like and where you like.”
This is, indeed, like the old days.
Well, then, about that chasm. I had no serious difficulty in getting out of it, for the very simple reason that I never was in it.
We tottered together upon the brink of the fall.
I have some knowledge, however, of baritsu, or the Japanese system of wrestling, which has more than once been very useful to me.
I saw him fall for a long way. Then he struck a rock, bounded off, and splashed into the water.
I listened with amazement to this explanation.
A mistake would have been fatal.
I don't have a good relationship with Tom.
Let's meet again in October.
Tom should wait.
Mary doesn't shave her legs.
I didn't want Tom to find me.
Mary rented a wedding dress.
I don't really have much in common with Tom.
Mary sounds like her mother.
We were scared and confused.
I travelled for two years in Tibet, therefore, and amused myself by visiting Lhassa, and spending some days with the head Llama.
“Work is the best antidote to sorrow, my dear Watson,” said he.
Work is the best antidote to sorrow.
In vain I begged him to tell me more.
It was indeed like old times when, at that hour, I found myself seated beside him in a hansom, my revolver in my pocket, and the thrill of adventure in my heart.
Holmes was cold and stern and silent.
He is confident of his abilities.
The two girls were close friends.
Mary and Alice are close friends.
"You'll come with me tonight?" When you like, where you like!
Greatness is close to madness.
A pirate is an enemy to all mankind.

Perspecticide is often part of a strategy of coercive control that may include manipulation, stalking, and physical abuse. Abusers make their partners narrow their worlds.
Once isolated, it is easy to lose one's sense of self. Abusers insist on controlling minute aspects of their partners' lives. Over time, victims internalize the rules and forget what life was like when they were freer to make their own choices.
Abusers make their partners feel badly about themselves. Because they are isolated, people victimized by perspecticide begin to believe the negative descriptions of themselves and lose self-esteem.  Abusive partners create the expectations.
The abuser demands certain acts as proof of love and over time, the person being victimized gives in.  "I do it because I care for you, because I love you, because I want to protect you."
People subjected to perspecticide often blame themselves, as they feel despairing and disoriented. It can be hard for them to figure out exactly what’s wrong.
Controlling partners serve as a filter for the outside world, gradually forcing their victims to lose the support of family, friends, and coworkers. Isolated and controlled in this way, victims lose self-esteem and have trouble remembering what they once thought, felt, and believed.
Nietzsche said: Without music, life would be a mistake.
Controlling men have no true sense of worth. Anger is their outlet. Manipulation is their tool. They cling to what they can not control, what they can not and should not have.
Their manipulation is so tuned and defined it is their way of life and pushes the edge of sociopathic behavior and delusional need.
Because of their semi-delusional state they are dangerous, but only to themselves and those they are trying to control. They will usually commit to a thought or idea that crushes their soul!
Think hard about your foe, for he is a mountain you will not bring down. You have never seen such a man nor had the opportunity to stand beside him in battle. You can not understand the likes of such, because you have not had such an opportunity. Life is a lesson. some are hard lesson, some unforgiving and damning. Some are irreversible and final. A man with nothing to lose is a man you must fear, for he will take you to the end.

"I wish we could consider the kindnesses of God towards us as we do those of men." "May He allow us to exercise that thought more often and more diligently." "That really is necessary if we are going to experience His kindness more often."
It is not a small kindness, which has come from very good inclinations.

"I got money from my father today, if you happen to need any." "I don't right now, but thanks a lot. You offer to do me a favour out of your own generosity and how many would do that?"

"What's the problem? I know you were given money yesterday." "I did indeed, but I have to buy books and other things I need."
"I don't wish to make things inconvenient." "When I have bought the things I need, if I have anything left, I will lend it to you."
"I admit it, but what then will you do with that money?" "I will buy paper and other things I need."
"What if you lose it?" "I will put up with it patiently."
"What if I happen to need something, will you give me a loan?" "I will gladly lend something to you." "Thank you."
"Where is your father now?" "I believe he is in Lyons."
"What is he doing there?" "Trading." "Since when?" "Since the start of the fair."
"I'm very surprised how long he dares to stay there, with such a great plague in that city." "It is not so surprising."
"Does it seem so to you?" "Yes, because he has been in greater danger many times, but the Lord God has always protected him."
"I believe it indeed, and will guard him still. But when is he returning?" "I don't know, we expect him every hour."
"God speed his return." "So I pray."
"Where are you going now?" "Straight home: farewell." "Farewell to you too."
"Why are you so happy?" "Because my father has just arrived."
"You don't say, where's he come from?" "London."
"When did he return?" "Just now, as I just told you."
"Have you already greeted him?" "I will greet him as soon as he's got off his horse."
