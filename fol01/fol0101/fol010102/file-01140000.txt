A U.S. government report says the impacts of climate change, including powerful storms, droughts and wildfires, are worsening in the United States.
"Future risks from climate change depend primarily on decisions made today," the report said.
The report predicts that climate change will cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century if no efforts are made to curb its effects and says global warming will disproportionately hurt the poor.
This year's National Climate Assessment is the fourth time the U.S. government has issued a comprehensive look at climate change.
Thirteen government departments and agencies, including the Department of Agriculture and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), were part of a committee of more than researchers who compiled the National Climate Assessment .
The Trump administration has rolled back several environmental regulations put in place during former President Barack Obama's administration and has promoted the production of fossil fuels.
Last year, Trump announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, which had been signed by nearly nations to combat climate change.
Trump, as well as several members of his Cabinet, have also cast doubt on the science of climate change, saying the causes of global warming are not yet settled.
When Meredith bought this northern Texas land several years ago, it was overgrazed and overrun with weeds. Now, she’s thrilled to find a dark green blob of fungus she rolls under her sparkly-nail-polished thumb.
Meredith picks a tiny patch of green moss from between clumps of tall brown grass gone dormant with the fall chill. “Look at all these little bits of biodiversity,” she said. “That’s like a little fantasy world going on in there.”
Scientists warn that the world needs to do more than just stop producing greenhouse gases in order to avoid the worst of climate change. Carbon dioxide needs to be actively removed from the atmosphere in order to keep the planet from potentially catastrophic warming.
Grasslands and the soils beneath them act as giant carbon sinks, the report notes. But not if they are overgrazed.

Earth’s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities.
The impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the future—but the severity of future impacts will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur.
Americans increasingly recognize the risks climate change poses to their everyday lives and livelihoods and are beginning to respond.
Water managers in the Colorado River Basin have mobilized users to conserve water in response to ongoing drought intensified by higher temperatures.
The state of Hawai‘i is developing management options to promote coral reef recovery from widespread bleaching events caused by warmer waters that threaten tourism, fisheries, and coastal protection from wind and waves.
Climate-related risks will continue to grow without additional action.
Decisions made today determine risk exposure for current and future generations and will either broaden or limit options to reduce the negative consequences of climate change.
Climate shapes where and how we live and the environment around us.
Natural ecosystems, agricultural systems, water resources, and the benefits they provide to society are adapted to past climate conditions and their natural range of variability.
The assumption that current and future climate conditions will resemble the recent past is no longer valid.
Observations collected around the world provide significant, clear, and compelling evidence that global average temperature is much higher, and is rising more rapidly, than anything modern civilization has experienced, with widespread and growing impacts.
The warming trend observed over the past century can only be explained by the effects that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, have had on the climate.
Climate change is transforming where and how we live and presents growing challenges to human health and quality of life, the economy, and the natural systems that support us.
Climate change threatens to exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities.
High temperature extremes and heavy precipitation events are increasing.
Glaciers and snow cover are shrinking.
Sea ice is retreating.
Seas are warming, rising, and becoming more acidic.
Marine species are moving to new locations toward cooler waters.
Flooding is becoming more frequent along the U.S. coastline.
Growing seasons are lengthening.
Wildfires are increasing.
These and many other changes are clear signs of a warming world.
Annual average temperatures have increased by 1.8°F across the contiguous United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
Alaska is warming faster than any other state and has warmed twice as fast as the global average since the mid-20th century.
The season length of heat waves in many U.S. cities has increased by over days since the 1960s.
Annual median sea level along the U.S. coast has increased by about inches since the early 20th century as oceans have warmed and land ice has melted.
Fish, shellfish, and other marine species along the Northeast coast and in the eastern Bering Sea have, on average, moved northward and to greater depths toward cooler waters since the early 1980s.
Oceans are currently absorbing more than a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere annually by human activities, increasing their acidity.
Scientists have understood the fundamental physics of climate change for almost years.
In the 1850s, researchers demonstrated that carbon dioxide and other naturally occurring greenhouse gases in the atmosphere prevent some of the heat radiating from Earth’s surface from escaping to space: this is known as the greenhouse effect.
Since the late 19th century, humans have released an increasing amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels and, to a lesser extent, deforestation and land-use change. As a result, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, the largest contributor to human-caused warming, has increased by about 40% over the industrial era.
This change in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has intensified the natural greenhouse effect, driving an increase in global surface temperatures and other widespread changes in Earth’s climate that are unprecedented in the history of modern civilization.
Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the only factors that can account for the observed warming over the last century; there are no credible alternative human or natural explanations supported by the observational evidence.
Without human activities, the influence of natural factors alone would actually have had a slight cooling effect on global climate over the last years.
Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities will continue to affect Earth’s climate for decades and even centuries.
Humans are adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere at a rate far greater than it is removed by natural processes, creating a long-lived reservoir of the gas in the atmosphere and oceans that is driving the climate to a warmer and warmer state.
Climate models representing our understanding of historical and current climate conditions are often used to project how our world will change under future conditions.

"Do you notice anything different about me?" asked Mary.
Today, the largest uncertainty in projecting future climate conditions is the level of greenhouse gas emissions going forward. Future global greenhouse gas emissions levels and resulting impacts depend on economic, political, and demographic factors that can be difficult to predict with confidence far into the future.
Many of the decisions we make every day are based on less-than-perfect knowledge.
Many of the decisions we make every day are based on less-than-perfect knowledge. For example, while GPS-based applications on smartphones can provide a travel-time estimate for our daily drive to work, an unexpected factor like a sudden downpour or fender bender might mean a ride originally estimated to be minutes could actually take longer.
Uncertainty is also a part of science.
A key goal of scientific research is to increase our confidence and reduce the uncertainty in our understanding of the world around us.
Studying Earth’s climate system is particularly challenging because it integrates many aspects of a complex natural system as well as many human-made systems.
While there is inherent uncertainty in climate science, there is high confidence in our understanding of the greenhouse effect and the knowledge that human activities are changing the climate in unprecedented ways. There is enough information to make decisions based on that understanding.
With substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the increase in global annual average temperature relative to preindustrial times could be limited to less than 3.6°F (2°C).
Without significant greenhouse gas mitigation, the increase in global annual average temperature could reach 9°F or more by the end of this century.
Climate change is a risk management challenge for society; it presents uncertain—and potentially severe—consequences for natural and human systems across generations.

Mitigation and adaptation activities can be considered complementary strategies—mitigation efforts can reduce future risks, while adaptation can minimize the consequences of changes that are already happening as a result of past and present greenhouse gas emissions.
Without more significant global greenhouse gas mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause substantial losses to infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century .

As humans have moved closer to forestlands, increased fire suppression practices have reduced natural fires and led to denser vegetation, resulting in fires that are larger and more damaging when they do occur.
Recent extreme events demonstrate the vulnerabilities of interconnected economic sectors to increasing risks from climate change.
In 2017, Hurricane Harvey dumped an unprecedented amount of rainfall over the greater Houston area, some of which has been attributed to human-induced climate change. Resulting power outages had cascading effects on critical infrastructure facilities such as hospitals and water and wastewater treatment plants.
In the Caribbean, Hurricanes Irma and Maria caused catastrophic damage to infrastructure, including the complete failure of Puerto Rico’s power grid.
The death toll in Puerto Rico grew in the three months following Maria’s landfall on the island due in part to the lack of electricity and potable water as well as access to medical facilities and medical care.
Without significant adaptation measures, many coastal cities in the Southeast are expected to experience daily high tide flooding by the end of the century.
In Alaska, thawing of permafrost is responsible for severe damage to roads, buildings, and pipelines that will be costly to replace, especially in remote parts of Alaska.

For decades, Americans have migrated toward urban areas seeking opportunities, emptying out large swaths of countryside.
For decades, Americans have migrated toward urban areas seeking opportunities, emptying out large swaths of countryside. In their wake, they have left shrinking communities that struggle to support multiple businesses, schools and hospitals.
As family farms have consolidated into megafarms run by large corporations, rural residents have moved to cities like Des Moines, the state capital, or left the state altogether.
Mallard, Iowa, located in northwest Iowa, has a population of about 265.
The northwest region of Iowa has been hit especially hard, forcing those who remain to drive farther and farther for things like groceries, education and health care.
At its peak, the town of Mallard hosted several grocery stores and restaurants, four churches, a cinema and two schools, one of them private. Today, its population of about supports little more than a gas station and a couple of bars.
The 100-year-old Catholic Church closed last summer, and the public school will close next year, forcing students to ride on buses to a neighboring town.
“We’re used to it. It’s not any big deal to us to have to travel a little ways,” she said. In her case, “a little ways” can mean a two-hour drive.
When Lanning learned she would be giving birth to twins, she was told that she could either schedule a cesarean section at her nearest hospital, about kilometers (miles) away, or travel to a better-equipped hospital kilometers (miles) away. She and her husband, John, chose to make the long drive and avoid the C-section.
Former horse trainer assistant Kayla Lanning had to drive miles (km) to deliver twins last year. They are now being treated by a specialist at yet another hospital, miles (km) away.
Many hospitals don’t even have an ultrasound machine to check the status of a baby, said Mandsager, the medical director of obstetrics at Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines.
He travels about kilometers (miles) each month to pay weekly visits to patients in rural health care centers.
According to a University of Minnesota study published earlier this year, million reproductive-age women live in America’s rural counties, but over half of these counties have no hospital where a woman can give birth.
As for whether couples may be dissuaded from settling in smaller towns because of these longer commutes, Lanning said it didn’t factor into her decision. “We are so grounded here. John grew up here, and everything we know and do is here. So yeah, that doesn’t affect that,” she said.
