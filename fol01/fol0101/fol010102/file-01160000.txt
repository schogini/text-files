I don't know how I did this.
She was a poor child, of a proud and arrogant nature, and her disposition was bad from the beginning.
When she was quite tiny, her greatest delight was to catch flies and pull their wings off, to make creeping insects of them.
She would catch chafers and beetles and stick them on a pin, after which she would push a leaf or a bit of paper close enough for them to seize with their feet; for the pleasure of seeing them writhe and wriggle in their efforts to free themselves from the pins.
She got worse rather than better as she grew older.
Inge got worse rather than better as she grew older; but she was very pretty.
Inge was sent into service in the country with some rich people. They treated her as if she had been their own child, and dressed her in the same style. She grew prettier and prettier, but her pride grew, too.
You ought to go home to see your parents, little Inge!
When she got to the town gates, and saw the young men and maids gossiping round the pond, and her mother sitting among them with a bundle of sticks she had picked up in the woods, Inge turned away. She was ashamed that one so fine as herself should have such a ragged old woman, who picked up sticks, for her mother.
She was ashamed that one so fine as herself should have such a ragged old woman, who picked up sticks, for her mother.
"Little Inge, you really ought to go and see your old parents," said her mistress. "Here is a large loaf of wheaten bread you may take to them. They will be pleased to see you."
Inge put on all her best clothes, and her fine new shoes.
She held up her skirts and picked her steps carefully so as to keep her shoes nice and clean.
When she came to the path through the marsh a great part of it was wet and muddy, she threw the loaf into the mud for a stepping-stone, to get over with dry shoes.
As she stood there with one foot on the loaf and was lifting up the other for the next step, the loaf sank deeper and deeper with her till she entirely disappeared. Nothing was to be seen but a black bubbling pool.
She heard the good people, her employers, who had been like parents to her, talking about her. "She was a sinful child," they said. "She did not value the gifts of God, but trod them under foot. She will find it hard to open the door of mercy."
She heard that a song had been written about her and sung all over the country, "The arrogant girl who trod on a loaf to keep her shoes clean."
Her heart was full of anger and malice toward everybody.
These words reached down into Inge's heart, and they seemed to do her good. It was the first time that any one said "Poor Inger," without adding anything about her misdeeds. A little innocent child was weeping and praying for her, and it made her feel quite odd: she would have liked to cry herself, but she could not shed a tear, and this was a further torment.
Then Inger again heard her name pronounced, and saw above her head what seemed to be two bright stars; they were in fact two kind eyes which were closing on earth. So many years had gone by since the little girl had cried so bitterly at the story of "Poor Inger," that the child had grown to be an old woman whom the Lord was now calling to Himself.
The old woman's eyes closed, and the eyes of her soul were opened to see the hidden things.
The peasants raised a pole against a wall, and tied a sheaf of oats on to the top, so that the little birds might have a good meal on the happy Christmas day.
The sun rose bright and shone upon the sheaf of oats, and the twittering birds surrounded the pole.
It was a very hard winter, and all the water had thick ice over it.
It was a very hard winter, and all the water had thick ice over it. The birds and wild creatures had great difficulty in finding food.
The little bird flew along the highways finding here and there in the tracks of the sledges a grain of corn.
The bird found a few morsels of bread, of which it would only eat a crumb, and gave the rest to the other starving sparrows which it called up.
Then the bird flew into the towns and peeped about.
Wherever a loving hand had strewn bread crumbs for the birds, the little bird only ate one crumb and gave the rest away.
In the course of the winter the bird had collected and given away so many crumbs of bread that they equalled in weight the whole loaf which little Inge had stepped upon to keep her shoes clean. When the last crumbs were found and given away, the bird's gray wings became white and spread themselves wide.
"A tern is flying away over the sea," said the children who saw the white bird. Now it dived into the sea, and now it soared up into the bright sunshine. It gleamed so brightly that it was not possible to see what became of it; they said it flew right into the sun.
Commas are complicated.
Her clothes were covered with slime, a snake had got among her hair, and hung dangling down her back.
A toad looked out of every fold in her dress, croaking like an asthmatic pug dog.
It was most unpleasant.
Worse than anything was the terrible hunger she felt, and she could not stoop down to break a bit of bread off the loaf she was standing on.
Her back had stiffened, her arms and hands had stiffened, and her whole body was like a pillar of stone.
She could only turn her eyes, but she could turn them right round, so as to look backward.
And then came the flies: they crept upon her eyes, and however much she winked they would not fly away; they could not, for she had pulled off their wings.
Certainly her mother wept bitterly and sorrowfully, but at the same time she said, "Pride goes before a fall! There was your misfortune, Inge! How you have grieved your mother."
Far out at sea the water is as blue as the bluest cornflower and as clear as the clearest crystal.
It is down there that the Mermen live.
The palace of the Merman King lies in the very deepest part; its walls are of coral and the long pointed windows of the clearest amber, but the roof is made of mussel shells which open and shut with the lapping of the water.
The Merman King had been for many years a widower.
The king's mother was fond of the little mermaid princesses, her grandchildren.
They were six beautiful children, but the youngest was the prettiest of all, her skin was as soft and delicate as a roseleaf, her eyes as blue as the deepest sea, but like all the others she had no feet, and instead of legs she had a fish's tail.
The youngest was the prettiest of all.
Her skin was as soft and delicate as a roseleaf.
Her eyes as blue as the deepest sea.
Like all the other mermaids, she had no feet and instead of legs she had a fish's tail.
When the great amber windows were thrown open the fish swam in, just as the swallows fly into our rooms when we open the windows.
The fish swam right up to the little princesses, ate out of their hands, and allowed themselves to be patted.
Outside the palace was a large garden, with fiery red and deep blue trees, the fruit of which shone like gold, while the flowers glowed like fire on their ceaselessly waving stalks.
The ground was of the finest sand.
Everything was bathed in a wondrous blue light.
Everything was bathed in a wondrous blue light down there; you might more readily have supposed yourself to be high up in the air, with only the sky above and below you, than that you were at the bottom of the ocean.
Each little princess had her own little plot of garden, where she could dig and plant just as she liked.
The youngest princess made her garden round like the sun, and she would only have flowers of a rosy hue like its beams.
She was a curious child, quiet and thoughtful.
While the other sisters decked out their gardens with all kinds of extraordinary objects which they got from wrecks, she would have nothing besides the rosy flowers like the sun up above, except a statue of a beautiful boy.
The statue was hewn out of the purest white marble.
By the statue she planted a rosy red weeping willow which grew splendidly, and the fresh delicate branches hung round and over it, till they almost touched the blue sand where the shadows showed violet.
Nothing gave her greater pleasure than to hear about the world of human beings up above.
She made her old grandmother tell her all that she knew about ships and towns, people and animals.
It seemed strangely beautiful to her that up on the earth the flowers were scented, for they were not so at the bottom of the sea.
The grandmother called little birds fish, or the mermaids would not have understood her, as they had never seen a bird.
"When you are fifteen," said the grandmother, "you will be allowed to rise up from the sea and sit on the rocks in the moonlight, and look at the big ships sailing by, and you will also see woods and towns."
One of the sisters would be fifteen In the following year, but the others—well, they were each one year younger than the other, so that the youngest had five whole years to wait before she would be allowed to come up from the bottom, to see what things were like on earth.
Each one promised the others to give a full account of all that she had seen and found most wonderful on the first day.
Their grandmother could never tell them enough, for there were so many things about which they wanted information.
None of them was so full of longings as the youngest, the very one who had the longest time to wait, and who was so quiet and dreamy.
Many a night she stood by the open windows and looked up through the dark blue water which the fish were lashing with their tails and fins.
She could see the moon and the stars. When she saw a dark shadow glide between her and them, she knew that it was either a whale swimming above her, or else a ship laden with human beings.
I am certain they never dreamt that a lovely little mermaid was standing down below, stretching up her white hands toward the keel.
The eldest princess had now reached her fifteenth birthday, and was to venture above the water.
When she came back she had hundreds of things to tell them, but the most delightful of all, she said, was to lie in the moonlight, on a sandbank in a calm sea, and to gaze at the large town close to the shore, where the lights twinkled like hundreds of stars; to listen to music and the noise and bustle of carriages and people, to see the many church towers and spires, and to hear the bells ringing.
And just because she could not go on shore she longed for that most of all.
Oh! how eagerly the youngest sister listened.
When, later in the evening she stood at the open window and looked up through the dark blue water, she thought of the big town with all its noise and bustle, and fancied that she could even hear the church bells ringing.
The year after, the second sister was allowed to mount up through the water and swim about wherever she liked.
The sun was just going down when she reached the surface, the most beautiful sight, she thought, that she had ever seen.
The whole sky had looked like gold.
The whole sky had looked like gold, she said, and as for the clouds! well, their beauty was beyond description, they floated in red and violet splendour over her head, and, far faster than they went, a flock of wild swans flew like a long white veil over the water toward the setting sun.
She swam toward the sun, but it sank and all the rosy light on clouds and water faded away.
The year after that the third sister went up, and being much the most venturesome of them all, swam up a broad river which ran into the sea.
She saw beautiful green, vine-clad hills; palaces and country seats peeping through splendid woods.
She heard the birds singing, and the sun was so hot that she was often obliged to dive, to cool her burning face.
In a tiny bay she found a troop of little children running about naked and paddling in the water; she wanted to play with them, but they were frightened and ran away.
Then a little black animal came up; it was a dog, but she had never seen one before; it barked so furiously at her that she was frightened and made for the open sea.
She could never forget the beautiful woods, the green hills, and the lovely children who could swim in the water although they had no fishes' tails.
The fourth sister was not so brave; she stayed in the remotest part of the ocean, and, according to her account, that was the most beautiful spot.
You could see for miles and miles around you, and the sky above was like a great glass dome.
She had seen ships, but only far away, so that they looked like sea-gulls.
There were grotesque dolphins turning somersaults, and gigantic whales squirting water through their nostrils like hundreds of fountains on every side.
Now the fifth sister's turn came. Her birthday fell in the winter, so that she saw sights that the others had not seen on their first trips.
The sea looked quite green, and large icebergs were floating about.
The icebergs took the most wonderful shapes, and sparkled like diamonds.
The princess had seated herself on one of the largest icebergs, and all the passing ships sheered off in alarm when they saw her sitting there with her long hair streaming loose in the wind.
In the evening the sky became overcast with dark clouds.
In the evening the sky became overcast with dark clouds; it thundered, and lightened, and the huge icebergs, glittering in the bright lightning, were lifted high into the air by the black waves.
All the ships shortened sail, and there was fear and trembling on every side, but she sat quietly on her floating iceberg watching the blue lightning flash in zigzags down on to the shining sea.
The first time any of the sisters rose above the water she was delighted by the novelties and beauties she saw; but once grown up, and at liberty to go where she liked, she became indifferent and longed for her home.
In the course of a month or so they all said that after all their own home in the deep was best, it was so cozy there.
Many an evening the five sisters interlacing their arms would rise above the water together.
They had lovely voices, much clearer than any mortal, and when a storm was rising, and they expected ships to be wrecked, they would sing in the most seductive strains of the wonders of the deep, bidding the seafarers have no fear of them.
But the sailors could not understand the words, they thought it was the voice of the storm.
When the ship sank the sailors drowned, and only reached the Merman's palace in death.
When the elder sisters rose up in this manner, arm-in-arm, in the evening, the youngest remained behind quite alone, looking after them as if she must weep, but mermaids have no tears and so they suffer all the more.
"Oh! if I were only fifteen!" she said.
At last her fifteenth birthday came.
"Come now, let me adorn you like your other sisters!" and she put a wreath of white lilies round her hair.
Then the old queen had eight oysters fixed on to the princess's tail to show her high rank.
"But it hurts so!" said the little mermaid. "You must endure the pain for the sake of the finery!" said her grandmother.
"Good-bye," she said, and mounted as lightly and airily as a bubble through the water.
The sun had just set when her head rose above the water, but the clouds were still lighted up with a rosy and golden splendour, and the evening star sparkled in the soft pink sky.
The air was mild and fresh, and the sea as calm as a millpond.
A big three-masted ship lay close by with only a single sail set, for there was not a breath of wind.
The sailors were sitting about the rigging, on the cross-trees, and at the mast-heads.
There was music and singing on board, and as the evening closed in, hundreds of gaily coloured lanterns were lighted.
The little mermaid swam right up to the cabin windows, and every time she was lifted by the swell she could see through the transparent panes crowds of gaily dressed people.
The handsomest of them all was the young prince with large dark eyes.
He could not be much more than sixteen.
All these festivities were in honour of his birthday.
The sailors danced on deck.
When the prince appeared among them, hundreds of rockets were let off, making it as light as day, and frightening the little mermaid so much that she had to dive under the water.
The little mermaid soon ventured up again, and it was just as if all the stars of heaven were falling in showers round about her.
Oh! how handsome the prince was, how he laughed and smiled as he greeted his guests, while the music rang out in the quiet night.
It got quite late, but the little mermaid could not take her eyes off the ship and the beautiful prince.
Oh, there was going to be a fearful storm!
The great ship rocked and rolled as she dashed over the angry sea.
The black waves rose like mountains.
The ship dived like a swan through the waves and rose again and again on their towering crests.
The little mermaid thought it a most amusing race, but not so the sailors.
The ship creaked and groaned, the mighty timbers bulged and bent under the heavy blows, the water broke over the decks, snapping the mainmast like a reed.
The ship heeled over on her side, and the water rushed into the hold.
Now the little mermaid saw that they were in danger.
She had for her own sake to beware of the floating beams and wreckage.
One moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see at all, but when the lightning flashed it became so light that she could see all on board.
Every man was looking out for his own safety as best he could.
She more particularly followed the young prince with her eyes, and when the ship went down she saw him sink in the deep sea.
At first she was quite delighted, for now he was coming to be with her, but then she remembered that human beings could not live under water.
No! he must not die; so she swam toward him all among the drifting beams and planks, quite forgetting that they might crush her.
She dived deep down under the water, and came up again through the waves, and at last reached the young prince just as he was becoming unable to swim any further in the stormy sea.
His limbs were numbed, his beautiful eyes were closing, and he must have died if the little mermaid had not come to the rescue.
She held his head above the water.
By daybreak the storm was over.
Of the ship, not a trace was to be seen.
The sun rose from the water in radiant brilliance and his rosy beams seemed to cast a glow of life into the prince's cheeks.
The sun rose from the water in radiant brilliance and his rosy beams seemed to cast a glow of life into the prince's cheeks, but his eyes remained closed.
The mermaid kissed his fair and lofty brow, and stroked back the dripping hair.
It seemed to her that he was like the marble statue in her little garden.
She kissed him again and longed that he might live.
At last she saw dry land before her, high blue mountains on whose summits the white snow glistened as if a flock of swans had settled there.
Down by the shore were beautiful green woods.
Lemon and orange trees grew in the garden.
At this point the sea formed a little bay where the water was quite calm, but very deep, right up to the cliffs.
At the foot of the cliffs was a strip of fine white sand, to which she swam with the beautiful prince, and laid him down on it.
The bells now began to ring in the great white building and a number of young maidens came into the garden.
Then the little mermaid swam farther off behind some high rocks and covered her hair and breast with foam, so that no one should see her little face.
Then she watched to see who would discover the poor prince.
It was not long before one of the maidens came up to him; at first she seemed quite frightened, but only for a moment, and then she fetched several others.
The mermaid saw that the prince was coming to life, and that he smiled at all those around him, but he never smiled at her.
He did not know that she had saved him.
She felt so sad that when he was led away into the great building she dived sorrowfully into the water and made her way home to her father's palace.
Always silent and thoughtful, she became more so now than ever.
Her sisters often asked her what she had seen on her first visit to the surface, but she never would tell them anything.
Many an evening and many a morning she would rise to the place where she had left the prince.
She saw the fruit in the garden ripen, and then gathered; she saw the snow melt on the mountain-tops, but she never saw the prince.
At home her only consolation was to sit in her little garden with her arms twined round the handsome marble statue which reminded her of the prince.
She had ceased to tend her flowers and the garden had become a neglected wilderness of long stalks and leaves entangled with the branches of the tree.
At last she could not bear it any longer, so she told one of her sisters, and from her it soon spread to the others, but to no one else except to one or two other mermaids who only told their dearest friends.
She swam much nearer the land than any of the others dared.
She used to sit here looking at the young prince, who thought he was quite alone in the clear moonlight.
She saw him many an evening sailing about in his beautiful boat, with flags waving and music playing.
If the wind happened to catch her long silvery veil and any one saw it, they only thought it was a swan flapping its wings.
Many a night she heard the fishermen, who were fishing by torchlight, talking over the good deeds of the young prince.
She was happy to think that she had saved his life when he was drifting about on the waves, half dead.
She could not forget how closely his head had pressed her breast, and how passionately she had kissed him.
She became fonder and fonder of mankind, and longed more and more to be able to live among them.
"If men are not drowned," asked the little mermaid, "do they live forever?"
"You must not be thinking about that," said the grandmother; "we are much better off and happier than human beings."
That which is your greatest beauty in the sea, your fish's tail, is thought hideous up on earth, so little do they understand about it; to be pretty there you must have two clumsy supports which they call legs!
Then the little mermaid sighed and looked sadly at her fish's tail.
"Let us be happy," said the grandmother; "we will hop and skip during our three hundred years of life—it is surely a long enough time—and after it is over we shall rest all the better in our graves. "
There is to be a court ball tonight.
The little mermaid sang more sweetly than any of them.
For a moment she felt glad at heart, for she knew that she had the finest voice either in the sea or on land.
She could not forget the handsome prince.
She sat sadly in her little garden.
I will dare anything to win him.
While my sisters are dancing in my father's palace, I will go to the sea witch of whom I have always been very much afraid; she will perhaps be able to advise and help me!
Thereupon the little mermaid left the garden and went toward the roaring whirlpools at the back of which the witch lived.
No flowers grew there, no seaweed, only the bare gray sands, stretched toward the whirlpools, which like rushing millwheels swirled round, dragging everything that came within reach down to the depths.
She had to pass between these boiling eddies to reach the witches' domain, and for a long way the only path led over warm bubbling mud.
Her house stood behind this in the midst of a weird forest.
The little mermaid standing outside was quite frightened, her heart beat fast with terror and she nearly turned back, but then she remembered the prince.
She bound her long flowing hair tightly round her head.
In the middle of this opening was a house built of the bones of the wrecked; there sat the witch, letting a toad eat out of her mouth.
She called the hideous water-snakes her little chickens, and allowed them to crawl about on her unsightly bosom.
"I know very well what you have come here for," said the witch. "It is very foolish of you!"
I'm addicted to drugs.
I will make you a potion, and before sunrise you must swim ashore with it, seat yourself on the beach and drink it; then your tail will divide and shrivel up to what men call beautiful legs, but it hurts, it is as if a sharp sword were running through you.
All who see you will say that you are the most beautiful child of man they have ever seen.
You will keep your gliding gait, no dancer will rival you, but every step you take will be as if you were treading upon sharp knives, so sharp as to draw blood.
If you are willing to suffer all this I am ready to help you!
"Yes!" said the little princess with a trembling voice.
"But remember," said the witch, "when once you have received a human form, you can never be a mermaid again; you will never again be able to dive down through the water to your sisters and to your father's palace."
Tom has an irrational fear of socialized medicine.
The first morning after his marriage with another your heart will break, and you will turn into foam of the sea.
"I will do it," said the little mermaid as pale as death.
Tom only likes socialized medicine when he needs it.
"But you will have to pay me, too," said the witch, "and it is no trifle that I demand. You have the most beautiful voice of any at the bottom of the sea, and I daresay that you think you will fascinate him with it, but you must give me that voice."
I will have the best you possess in return for my precious potion!
"But if you take my voice," said the little mermaid, "what have I left?"
"But if you take my voice," said the little mermaid, "what have I left?" "Your beautiful form," said the witch, "your gliding gait, and your speaking eyes; with these you ought surely to be able to bewitch a human heart."
Well! have you lost courage? Put out your little tongue and I will cut it off in payment for the powerful draught.
Tom advocates socialized medicine.
"Let it be done," said the little mermaid, and the witch put on her cauldron to brew the magic potion.
"There is nothing like cleanliness," said she, as she scoured the pot with a bundle of snakes.
Then she punctured her breast and let the black blood drop into the cauldron.
The steam took the most weird shapes, enough to frighten any one.
Tom's managed health care plan denied his medication.
Every moment the witch threw new ingredients into the pot, and when it boiled the bubbling was like the sound of crocodiles weeping.
At last the potion was ready and it looked like the clearest water.
"There it is," said the witch, and thereupon she cut off the tongue of the little mermaid, who was dumb now and could neither sing nor speak.
"There it is," said the witch, and thereupon she cut off the tongue of the little mermaid.
Tom claims he doesn't know anything. Do you buy it?
Tom localizes smartphone apps for a major developer.
She saw her father's palace. The lights were all out in the great ballroom, and no doubt all the household was asleep.
She was about to leave her home forever.
She felt as if her heart would break with grief.
She stole into the garden and plucked a flower from each of her sister's plots, wafted with her hand countless kisses toward the palace, and then rose up through the dark blue water.
The sun had not risen when she came in sight of the prince's palace and landed at the beautiful marble steps.
The moon was shining bright and clear.
The little mermaid drank the burning, stinging draught, and it was like a sharp two-edged sword running through her tender frame.
She fainted away and lay as if she were dead.
Tom's activism didn't seem to have any identifiable effect.
When the sun rose on the sea she woke up and became conscious of a sharp pang, but just in front of her stood the handsome young prince, fixing his coal-black eyes on her.
She cast her eyes down and saw that her fish's tail was gone.
She had the prettiest little white legs any maiden could desire, but she was quite naked, so she wrapped her long thick hair around her.
The prince asked who she was and how she came there.
She looked at him tenderly and with a sad expression in her dark-blue eyes, but could not speak.
Antifascists often mask their faces to make themselves less identifiable to the police.
Then he took her by the hand and led her into the palace.
Every step she took was, as the witch had warned her beforehand, as if she were treading on sharp knives and spikes, but she bore it gladly.
Led by the prince she moved as lightly as a bubble, and he and every one else marvelled at her graceful gliding gait.
Clothed in the costliest silks and muslins, she was the greatest beauty in the palace.
Clothed in the costliest silks and muslins, she was the greatest beauty in the palace, but she could neither sing nor speak.
The amendment is still pending ratification.
Beautiful slaves clad in silks and gold came forward and sang to the prince and his royal parents.
That made the little mermaid very sad, for she knew that she used to sing far better herself.
She thought: "Oh! if he only knew that for the sake of being with him I had given up my voice forever!"
Now the slaves began to dance graceful undulating dances to enchanting music.
Thereupon the little mermaid, lifting her beautiful white arms and raising herself on tiptoe, glided on the floor with a grace which none of the other dancers had yet attained.
With every motion her grace and beauty became more apparent.
She danced on and on, notwithstanding that every time her foot touched the ground it was like treading on sharp knives.
The prince said that she should always be near him, and she was allowed to sleep outside his door on a velvet cushion.
He had a man's dress made for her, so that she could ride about with him.
They used to ride through scented woods, where the green branches brushed her shoulders, and little birds sang among the fresh leaves.
She climbed up the highest mountains with the prince, and although her delicate feet bled so that others saw it, she only laughed and followed him until they saw the clouds sailing below them like a flock of birds, taking flight to distant lands.
At home in the prince's palace, when at night the others were asleep, she used to go out on to the marble steps; it cooled her burning feet to stand in the cold sea water, and at such times she used to think of those she had left in the deep.
Day by day she became dearer to the prince; he loved her as one loves a good, sweet child, but it never entered his head to make her his queen.
"Am I not dearer to you than any of them?" the little mermaid's eyes seemed to say when he took her in his arms and kissed her beautiful brow.
"Yes, you are the dearest one to me," said the prince, "for you have the best heart of them all, and you are fondest of me."
You are like a young girl I once saw, but whom I never expect to see again.
I was on board a ship which was wrecked; I was driven on shore by the waves close to a holy Temple where several young girls were ministering at a service; the youngest of them found me on the beach and saved my life; I saw her but twice. She was the only person I could love in this world, but you are like her, you almost drive her image out of my heart.
"Alas! he does not know that it was I who saved his life," thought the little mermaid.
"The girl belongs to the holy Temple, he has said; she will never return to the world; they will never meet again; I am here with him; I see him every day. Yes! I will tend him, love him, and give up my life to him."
But now the rumour ran that the prince was to be married to the beautiful daughter of a neighbouring king.
It was given out that the prince was going on a voyage to see the adjoining countries, but it was without doubt to see the king's daughter.
She knew the prince's intentions much better than any of the others.
"I must take this voyage," he had said to her; "I must go and see the beautiful princess; my parents demand that, but they will never force me to bring her home as my bride; I can never love her!"
She will not be like the lovely girl in the Temple whom you resemble.
"You are not frightened of the sea, I suppose?" he said, as they stood on the proud ship which was to carry them to the country of the neighbouring king.
He told her about storms and calms, about curious fish in the deep, and the marvels seen by divers.
She smiled at his tales, for she knew all about the bottom of the sea much better than any one else.
At night, in the moonlight, when all were asleep, except the steersman who stood at the helm, she sat at the side of the ship trying to pierce the clear water with her eyes, and fancied she saw her father's palace, and above it her old grandmother with her silver crown on her head, looking up through the cross currents toward the keel of the ship.
The next morning the ship entered the harbour of the neighbouring king's magnificent city.
The church bells rang and trumpets were sounded from every lofty tower, while the soldiers paraded with flags flying and glittering bayonets.
There was a fête every day.
There was a succession of balls, and receptions followed one after the other, but the princess was not yet present.
At last she came. The little mermaid stood eager to see her beauty, and she was obliged to confess that a lovelier creature she had never beheld.
Her complexion was exquisitely pure and delicate, and her trustful eyes of the deepest blue shone through their dark lashes.
"It is you," said the prince, "you who saved me when I lay almost lifeless on the beach?" and he clasped his blushing bride to his heart.
"Oh, I am too happy!" he exclaimed to the little mermaid.
A greater joy than I had dared to hope for has come to pass. You will rejoice at my joy, for you love me better than any one.
Then the little mermaid kissed his hand, and felt as if her heart were broken already.
His wedding morn would bring death to her and change her to foam.
All the church bells pealed and heralds rode through the town proclaiming the nuptials.
Upon every altar throughout the land fragrant oil was burnt in costly silver lamps.
Amidst the swinging of censers by the priests, the bride and bridegroom joined hands and received the bishop's blessing.
The little mermaid dressed in silk and gold stood holding the bride's train, but her ears were deaf to the festal strains, her eyes saw nothing of the sacred ceremony. She was thinking of her coming death and of all that she had lost in this world.
That same evening the bride and bridegroom embarked, amidst the roar of cannon and the waving of banners.
A royal tent of purple and gold softly cushioned was raised amidships, where the bridal pair were to repose during the calm cool night.
The sails swelled in the wind and the ship skimmed lightly and almost without motion over the transparent sea.
At dusk lanterns of many colours were lighted and the sailors danced merrily on deck.
The little mermaid could not help thinking of the first time she came up from the sea and saw the same splendour and gaiety.
She now threw herself among the dancers, whirling, as a swallow skims through the air when pursued.
The onlookers cheered her in amazement.
Never had she danced so divinely.
Her delicate feet pained her as if they were cut with knives, but she did not feel it, for the pain at her heart was much sharper.
She knew that it was the last night that she would breathe the same air as he, and would look upon the mighty deep, and the blue starry heavens.
An endless night without thought and without dreams awaited her.
The joy and revelry on board lasted till long past midnight.
She went on laughing and dancing with the thought of death all the time in her heart.
The prince caressed his lovely bride and she played with his raven locks, and with their arms entwined they retired to the gorgeous tent.
All became hushed and still on board the ship.
The little mermaid laid her white arms on the gunwale and looked eastward for the pink-tinted dawn.
The first sunbeam, she knew, would be her death.
Then she saw her sisters rise from the water, they were as pale as she was, their beautiful long hair no longer floated on the breeze, for it had been cut off. "We have given it to the witch to obtain her help, so that you may not die to-night! she has given us a knife, here it is, look how sharp it is! Before the sun rises, you must plunge it into the prince's heart, and when his warm blood sprinkles your feet they will join together and grow into a tail, and you will once more be a mermaid."
Make haste! you or he must die before sunrise!
Slay the prince and come back to us!
Quick! Quick! do you not see the rosy streak in the sky? In a few moments the sun will rise and then you must die!
Quick! Quick! do you not see the rosy streak in the sky? In a few moments the sun will rise and then you will die!
The little mermaid drew aside the purple curtain from the tent and looked at the beautiful bride asleep with her head on the prince's breast.
She bent over him and kissed his fair brow, looked at the sky where the dawn was spreading fast; looked at the sharp knife, and again fixed her eyes on the prince who, in his dream, called his bride by name.
For a moment the knife quivered in her grasp, then she threw it far out among the waves now rosy in the morning light, and where it fell the water bubbled up like drops of blood.
Once more she looked at the prince, with her eyes already dimmed by death, then dashed overboard and fell, her body dissolving into foam.
Now the sun rose from the sea and with its kindly beams warmed the deadly cold foam, so that the little mermaid did not feel the chill of death.
She saw the bright sun and above her floated hundreds of beauteous ethereal beings through which she could see the white ship and the rosy heavens.

The young couple broke a piece of gold together, and pledged their troth in the most solemn manner; and it is said the young lady imprecated dreadful evils on herself should she break her plighted faith.
Shortly after, a suitor who was favoured by Lord Stair, and still more so by his lady, paid his addresses to Miss Dalrymple. The young lady refused the proposal, and being pressed on the subject, confessed her secret engagement.
Lady Stair, a woman accustomed to universal submission, for even her husband did not dare to contradict her, treated this objection as a trifle, and insisted upon her daughter yielding her consent to marry the new suitor, David Dunbar, son and heir to David Dunbar of Baldoon, in Wigtonshire.
The first lover, a man of very high spirit, then interfered by letter, and insisted on the right he had acquired by his troth plighted with the young lady.
Lady Stair sent him for answer, that her daughter, sensible of her undutiful behaviour in entering into a contract unsanctioned by her parents, had retracted her unlawful vow, and now refused to fulfil her engagement with him.
The lover, in return, declined positively to receive such an answer from any one but his mistress in person.
She had to deal with a man who was both of a most determined character and of too high condition to be trifled with.
Lady Stair was obliged to consent to an interview between Lord Rutherford and her daughter.
She particularly insisted on the Levitical law, which declares that a woman shall be free of a vow which her parents dissent from.
The lover in vain conjured the daughter to declare her own opinion and feelings.
She remained totally overwhelmed, as it seemed—mute, pale, and motionless as a statue
Only at her mother's command, sternly uttered, she summoned strength enough to restore to her plighted suitor the piece of broken gold which was the emblem of her troth.
On this he burst forth into a tremendous passion, took leave of the mother with maledictions, and as he left the apartment, turned back to say to his weak, if not fickle, mistresss: “For you, madam, you will be a world's wonder”; a phrase by which some remarkable degree of calamity is usually implied.
He went abroad, and returned not again.
The marriage betwixt Janet Dalrymple and David Dunbar of Baldoon now went forward, the bride showing no repugnance, but being absolutely passive in everything her mother commanded or advised.
On the day of the marriage, which, as was then usual, was celebrated by a great assemblage of friends and relations, she was the same—sad, silent, and resigned, as it seemed, to her destiny.
Her hand, which lay on his as she held her arm around his waist, was as cold and damp as marble.
The bridal feast was followed by dancing.
The bride and bridegroom retired as usual, when of a sudden the most wild and piercing cries were heard from the nuptial chamber.
It was then the custom, to prevent any coarse pleasantry which old times perhaps admitted, that the key of the nuptial chamber should be entrusted to the bridesman.
He was called upon, but refused at first to give it up, till the shrieks became so hideous that he was compelled to hasten with others to learn the cause.
On opening the door, they found the bridegroom lying across the threshold, dreadfully wounded, and streaming with blood.
The bride was then sought for. She was found in the corner of the large chimney, having no covering save her shift, and that dabbled in gore.
There she sat grinning at them, mopping and mowing, as I heard the expression used; in a word, absolutely insane.
She survived this horrible scene little more than a fortnight, having been married on the 24th of August, and dying on the 12th of September 1669.
The unfortunate Baldoon recovered from his wounds, but sternly prohibited all inquiries respecting the manner in which he had received them.
“If a lady,” he said, “asked him any question upon the subject, he would neither answer her nor speak to her again while he lived; if a gentleman, he would consider it as a mortal affront, and demand satisfaction as having received such.”
He did not very long survive the dreadful catastrophe, having met with a fatal injury by a fall from his horse.
Various reports went abroad on this mysterious affair, many of them very inaccurate, though they could hardly be said to be exaggerated.
It was difficult at that time to become acquainted with the history of a Scottish family above the lower rank; and strange things sometimes took place there, into which even the law did not scrupulously inquire.
I am too stubborn in habits, and too little polished in manners, to envy or aspire to the honours assigned to my literary contemporaries.
“Why do you look so pale, Lucy?” said her father, turning suddenly round and breaking silence.
According to the ideas of the time, which did not permit a young woman to offer her sentiments on any subject of importance unless required to do so, Lucy was bound to appear ignorant of the meaning of all that had passed betwixt Alice and her father.
A bull, stimulated either by the scarlet colour of Miss Ashton's mantle, or by one of those fits of capricious ferocity to which their dispositions are liable, detached himself suddenly from the group which was feeding at the upper extremity of a grassy glade, that seemed to lose itself among the crossing and entangled boughs. The animal approached the intruders on his pasture ground, at first slowly, pawing the ground with his hoof, bellowing from time to time, and tearing up the sand with his horns, as if to lash himself up to rage and violence.
Encouraged by the appearance of flight, the bull began to pursue them at full speed.
It seemed inevitable that the father or daughter, or both, should have fallen victims to the impending danger, when a shot from the neighbouring thicket arrested the progress of the animal.
Lucy lay senseless on the ground, insensible of the wonderful deliverance which she had experienced.
Her father was almost equally stupified, so rapid and unexpected had been the transition from the horrid death which seemed inevitable to perfect security.
He gazed on the animal, terrible even in death, with a species of mute and confused astonishment.
He might have supposed the bull had been arrested in its career by a thunderbolt, had he not observed among the branches of the thicket the figure of a man, with a short gun or musquetoon in his hand.
A glance at his daughter reminded him of the necessity of procuring her assistance.
In a few hurried words he directed the shooter, a stronger and more active man than himself, to carry the young lady to a neighbouring fountain, while he went back to Alice's hut to procure more aid.
He raised Lucy from the ground in his arms, and conveying her through the glades of the forest by paths with which he seemed well acquainted, stopped not until he laid her in safety by the side of a plentiful and pellucid fountain, which had been once covered in, screened and decorated with architectural ornaments of a Gothic character.
But now the vault which had covered the fountain being broken down and riven, and the Gothic font ruined and demolished, the stream burst forth from the recess of the earth in open day, and winded its way among the broken sculpture and moss-grown stones which lay in confusion around its source.
Tradition, always busy, at least in Scotland, to grace with a legendary tale a spot in itself interesting, had ascribed a cause of peculiar veneration to this fountain.
A beautiful young lady met one of the Lords of Ravenswood while hunting near this spot.
A beautiful young lady met one of the Lords of Ravenswood while hunting near this spot, and, like a second Egeria, had captivated the affections of the feudal Numa.
They met frequently afterwards.
They met frequently afterwards, and always at sunset.
The charms of the nymph's mind completed the conquest which her beauty had begun, and the mystery of the intrigue added zest to both.
She always appeared and disappeared close by the fountain, with which, therefore, her lover judged she had some inexplicable connexion.
They met only once a week.
Friday was the appointed day.
She explained to the Lord of Ravenswood that they were under the necessity of separating so soon as the bell of a chapel, belonging to a hermitage in the adjoining wood, now long ruinous, should toll the hour of vespers.
Father Zachary drew the necessary and obvious consequence that his patron was enveloped in the toils of Satan, and in danger of destruction, both to body and soul.
Father Zachary urged these perils to the Baron with all the force of monkish rhetoric.
He described, in the most frightful colours, the real character and person of the apparently lovely Naiad, whom he hesitated not to denounce as a limb of the kingdom of darkness.
The lover listened with obstinate incredulity.
It was not until worn out by the obstinacy of the anchoret that he consented to put the state and condition of his mistress to a certain trial.
He acquiesced in Zachary's proposal that on their next interview the vespers bell should be rung half an hour later than usual.
The hermit maintained and bucklered his opinion, by quotations from Malleus Malificarum, Sprengerus, Remigius, and other learned demonologists, that the Evil One, thus seduced to remain behind the appointed hour, would assume her true shape, and, having appeared to her terrified lover as a fiend of hell, would vanish from him in a flash of sulphurous lightning.
The hermit maintained that the Evil One, thus seduced to remain behind the appointed hour, would assume her true shape, and, having appeared to her terrified lover as a fiend of hell, would vanish from him in a flash of sulphurous lightning.
Raymond of Ravenswood acquiesced in the experiment, not incurious concerning the issue, though confident it would disappoint the expectations of the hermit.
At the appointed hour, the lovers met.
Their interview was protracted beyond that at which they usually parted.
No change took place upon the nymph's outward form.
As soon as the lengthening shadows made her aware that the usual hour of the vespers chime was passed, she tore herself from her lover's arms with a shriek of despair, bid him adieu for ever, and, plunging into the fountain, disappeared from his eyes.
The bubbles occasioned by her descent were crimsoned with blood as they arose.
In memory of his Naiad, he had previously ornamented the fountain in which she appeared to reside, and secured its waters from profanation or pollution by the small vaulted building of which the fragments still remained scattered around it.
From this period the house of Ravenswood was supposed to have dated its decay.
All agreed that the spot was fatal to the Ravenswood family; and that to drink of the waters of the well, or even approach its brink, was ominous to a descendant of that house.
Another means of silently lessening the inequality of property is to exempt all from taxation below a certain point, and to tax the higher portions of property in geometrical progression as they rise.
Whenever there is in any country, uncultivated lands and unemployed poor, it is clear that the laws of property have been so far extended as to violate natural right.
It was on this ominous spot that Lucy Ashton first drew breath after her long and almost deadly swoon.
Beautiful and pale as the fabulous Naiad in the last agony of separation from her lover, she was seated so as to rest with her back against a part of the ruined wall, while her mantle, dripping with the water which her protector had used profusely to recall her senses, clung to her slender and beautifully proportioned form.
The first moment of recollection brought to her mind the danger which had overpowered her senses; the next called to remembrance that of her father.
She looked around. He was nowhere to be seen.
“Sir William is safe,” answered the voice of a stranger.
“Are you sure of that?” exclaimed Lucy.
Do not stop me: I must go to seek my father!
The stranger was so near to her that, without actually suffering her to fall, he could not avoid catching her in his arms.
It seemed as if her weight, slight as it was, proved too heavy for her young and athletic assistant, for, without feeling the temptation of detaining her in his arms even for a single instant, he again placed her on the stone from which she had risen.
You, madam, are exhausted, and must not think of rising until you have some assistance more suitable than mine.
Lucy, whose senses were by this time more effectually collected, was naturally led to look at the stranger with attention.
A shooting-dress of dark cloth intimated the rank of the wearer, though concealed in part by a large and loose cloak of a dark brown colour.
A montero cap and a black feather drooped over the wearer's brow.
A montero cap and a black feather drooped over the wearer's brow, and partly concealed his features, which, so far as seen, were dark, regular, and full of majestic, though somewhat sullen, expression.
Some secret sorrow, or the brooding spirit of some moody passion, had quenched the light and ingenuous vivacity of youth.
The impression which we have necessarily been long in describing, Lucy felt in the glance of a moment.
She had no sooner encountered the keen black eyes of the stranger than her own were bent on the ground with a mixture of bashful embarrassment and fear.
Lucy was surprised at the ambiguity of his language.
“My name is unnecessary,” answered the stranger.
“Oh, if you be a man,” she said—“if you be a gentleman, assist me to find my father!"
You shall not leave me.
You must go with me.
He is dying perhaps while we are talking here!
His joy at seeing his daughter safe overcame the surprise with which he would at another time have beheld her hanging as familiarly on the arm of a stranger as she might have done upon his own.
Lucy, my dear Lucy, are you safe?—are you well?
"This gentleman," said Sir William Ashton, "will, I trust, not regret the trouble we have given him, when I assure him of the gratitude of the Lord Keeper for the greatest service which one man ever rendered to another—for the life of my child—for my own life, which he has saved by his bravery and presence of mind."
“Request nothing of ME, my lord,” said the stranger, in a stern and peremptory tone; “I am the Master of Ravenswood.”
There was a dead pause of surprise, not unmixed with less pleasant feelings.
The Master wrapt himself in his cloak, made a haughty inclination toward Lucy, muttering a few words of courtesy, as indistinctly heard as they seemed to be reluctantly uttered, and, turning from them, was immediately lost in the thicket.
“The Master of Ravenswood!” said the Lord Keeper, when he had recovered his momentary astonishment.
Hasten after him—stop him—beg him to speak to me for a single moment.
The two foresters accordingly set off in pursuit of the stranger. They speedily reappeared, and, in an embarrassed and awkward manner, said the gentleman would not return.
Tell Sir William Ashton that the next time he and I forgather, he will not be half so blythe of our meeting as of our parting.
Tell Sir William Ashton that the next time he and I meet, he will not be half so glad of our meeting as of our parting.
It is a matter of no consequence.
He turned to his daughter, who was by this time so much recovered as to be able to walk home.
The effect, which the various recollections connected with a scene so terrific made upon a mind which was susceptible in an extreme degree, was more permanent than the injury which her nerves had sustained.
Visions of terror, both in sleep and in waking reveries, recalled to her the form of the furious animal.
It was always the image of the Master of Ravenswood, with his native nobleness of countenance and form, that seemed to interpose betwixt her and assured death.
She had never happened to see a young man of mien and features so romantic and so striking as young Ravenswood.
She knew little of Ravenswood, or the disputes which had existed betwixt her father and his.
She knew that he was come of noble stem and was poor, though descended from the noble and the wealthy.
She felt that she could sympathise with the feelings of a proud mind, which urged him to recoil from the proffered gratitude of the new proprietors of his father's house and domains.
Lucy Ashton, in short, was involved in those mazes of the imagination which are most dangerous to the young and the sensitive.
Time, it is true, absence, change of scene and new faces, might probably have destroyed the illusion in her instance, as it has done in many others; but her residence remained solitary, and her mind without those means of dissipating her pleasing visions.
Her solitude was chiefly owing to the absence of Lady Ashton, who was at this time in Edinburgh, watching the progress of some state-intrigue.
The Lord Keeper only received society out of policy or ostentation, and was by nature rather reserved and unsociable.
And thus no cavalier appeared to rival or to obscure the ideal picture of chivalrous excellence which Lucy had pictured to herself in the Master of Ravenswood.
While Lucy indulged in these dreams, she made frequent visits to old blind Alice, hoping it would be easy to lead her to talk on the subject which at present she had so imprudently admitted to occupy so large a portion of her thoughts.
The little she said of him was not altogether so favourable as Lucy had anticipated.
She hinted that he was of a stern and unforgiving character, more ready to resent than to pardon injuries.
She conceived that some secret prejudice, or the suspicions incident to age and misfortune, had led Alice to form conclusions injurious to the character, and irreconcilable both with the generous conduct and noble features, of the Master of Ravenswood.
In this belief Lucy reposed her hope, and went on weaving her enchanted web of fairy tissue, as beautiful and transient as the film of the gossamer when it is pearled with the morning dew and glimmering to the sun.
The Lord Keeper's first task, when he returned home, was to ascertain by medical advice that his daughter had sustained no injury from the dangerous and alarming situation in which she had been placed.
On the evening of the day when the Lord Keeper and his daughter were saved from such imminent peril, two strangers were seated in the most private apartment of a small obscure inn, or rather alehouse, called the Tod's Den, about three or four miles from the Castle of Ravenswood.
One of these strangers was about forty years of age, tall, and thin in the flanks, with an aquiline nose, dark penetrating eyes, and a shrewd but sinister cast of countenance.
The other was about fifteen years younger, short, stout, ruddy-faced, and red-haired, with an open, resolute, and cheerful eye.
The other was about fifteen years younger, short, stout, ruddy-faced, and red-haired, with an open, resolute, and cheerful eye, to which careless and fearless freedom and inward daring gave fire and expression, notwithstanding its light grey colour.
A stoup of wine (for in those days it was served out from the cask in pewter flagons) was placed on the table, and each had his quaigh or bicker before him.
They eyed each other in silence.
Craigengelt drew his cutlass an inch or two, and then returned it with violence into the scabbard.
He has always distrusted me.
You are as easily scared as a wild goose.
I think I hear three or four horses galloping together.
I am sure I hear more horses than one.
But here comes the Master alone, and looking as gloomy as a night in November.
The Master of Ravenswood entered the room accordingly, his cloak muffled around him, his arms folded, his looks stern, and at the same time dejected.
He flung his cloak from him as he entered, threw himself upon a chair, and appeared sunk in a profound reverie.
Take my purse and pay yourself according to your own conscience.
He tendered a purse with some gold in it to the soi-disant captain.
I have had more of his insolence than I can well digest.
No man injures me by word, deed, sign, or look, but he must render me an account of it.
I have no quarrel with you, and desire to have none.
He was my companion for the time, and no man shall insult my companion, right or wrong, while he is in my company.
"Then, Mr. Hayston," replied Ravenswood, with the same composure, "you should choose your society better."
If you are serious, this place will serve as well as another.
This place will serve as well as another.
“Dismount then, and draw,” said Bucklaw.
Their swords crossed, and the combat commenced.
Bucklaw was well accustomed to affairs of the kind, and distinguished by address and dexterity at his weapon.
The Master, with equal skill, and much greater composure, remained chiefly on the defensive, and even declined to avail himself of one or two advantages afforded him by the eagerness of his adversary.
At length, in a desperate lunge, which he followed with an attempt to close, Bucklaw's foot slipped, and he fell on the short grassy turf on which they were fighting.
“Take your life, sir,” said the Master of Ravenswood, “and mend it if you can.”
“I thank you for my life, Master,” he pursued.
I bear no ill-will to you, either for my bad luck or your better swordsmanship.
Men are never so ready for peace as after war.
Ride home to Wolf's Crag with me. There are places in the old tower where you might lie hid, were a thousand men to seek you.
They rode for some time in silence.
You have nourished in your bosom the snakes that are now stinging you.
"What, to speak without a metaphor, do you call this monstrous passion which you charge me with fostering?" "Revenge, my good sir—revenge."
I am glad to see that the devil deals as cunningly with other folk as he deals with me; for whenever I am about to commit any folly, he persuades me it is the most necessary, gallant, gentlemanlike thing on earth, and I am up to saddlegirths in the bog before I see that the ground is soft.
The pale moon, which had hitherto been contending with flitting clouds, now shone out, and gave them a view of the solitary and naked tower.
The tower, tall and narrow, and built of a greyish stone, stood glimmering in the moonlight, like the sheeted spectre of some huge giant.
A wilder or more disconsolate dwelling it was perhaps difficult to conceive.
"There," said Ravenswood, "sits the only male domestic that remains to the house of Ravenswood; and it is well that he does remain there, since otherwise we had little hope to find either light or fire. "
But follow me cautiously; the road is narrow, and admits only one horse in front.
At length a timid and hesitating voice replied: “Master—Master of Ravenswood, is it you?” “Yes, it is I, Caleb; open the door quickly.”
“It is I, you old fool,” answered Ravenswood, “in bodily shape and alive, save that I am half dead with cold.”
The light at the upper window disappeared.
At length Caleb, with a trembling hand, undid the bars, opened the heavy door, and stood before them, exhibiting his thin grey hairs, bald forehead, and sharp high features, illuminated by a quivering lamp which he held in one hand, while he shaded and protected its flame with the other.
Tom rubbed his hands heartily over the fire.
Her family are all very well.
Comfort I cannot provide for you, for I have it not for myself.
Shelter and safety, I think, I can promise you.
His misery had been bequeathed to him by his father.
The morning, which had arisen calm and bright, gave a pleasant effect even to the waste moorland view which was seen from the castle on looking to the landward.
The glorious ocean, crisped with a thousand rippling waves of silver, extended on the other side of the castle, in awful yet complacent majesty, to the verge of the horizon.
With such scenes of calm sublimity the human heart sympathises even in its most disturbed moods.
With such scenes of calm sublimity the human heart sympathises even in its most disturbed moods, and deeds of honour and virtue are inspired by their majestic influence.
The very recollection of Caleb's beverage has done more to suppress my longing to open the day with a morning draught than twenty sermons would have done.

The first sight of Lucy Ashton had been less impressive than her image proved to be upon reflection.
He looked back on his conduct towards the daughter as harsh and unworthy towards a female of rank and beauty.
The recollection of Lucy Ashton's beautiful features, rendered yet more interesting by the circumstances in which their meeting had taken place, made an impression upon his mind at once soothing and painful.
The sweetness of her voice, the delicacy of her expressions, the vivid glow of her filial affection, embittered his regret at having repulsed her gratitude with rudeness.
The sweetness of her voice, the delicacy of her expressions, the vivid glow of her filial affection, embittered his regret at having repulsed her gratitude with rudeness, while, at the same time, they placed before his imagination a picture of the most seducing sweetness.
There existed in his bosom two contradictory passions—a desire to revenge the death of his father, strangely qualified by admiration of his enemy's daughter.
Caleb seldom made an excursion from the old fortress to the neighbouring village of Wolf's Hope without bringing back what tidings were current in the vicinity.
Light meals procure light slumbers.
In the morning Bucklaw rushed into his host's apartment with a loud halloo, which might have awaked the dead.
I have saddled the horses myself.
Help me on with my cloak, and hand me my sword-belt.
What clatter is that in the courtyard?
Animated by the natural impetuosity and fire of his temper, young Bucklaw rushed on with the careless speed of a whirlwind.
