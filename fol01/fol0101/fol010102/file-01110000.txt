We emerged at last into a small road, lined with old, gloomy houses.
He turned swiftly down a narrow passage, passed through a wooden gate into a deserted yard, and then opened with a key the back door of a house. We entered together, and he closed it behind us.
Tom is the most dangerous man in Boston.
Holmes’ cold, thin fingers closed round my wrist and led me forwards down a long hall, until I dimly saw the murky fanlight over the door.
It was evident to me that he was becoming uneasy, and that his plans were not working out altogether as he had hoped.
At last, as midnight approached and the street gradually cleared, he paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation.
A door opened and shut. An instant later steps crept down the passage—steps which were meant to be silent, but which reverberated harshly through the empty house.
Holmes crouched back against the wall and I did the same, my hand closing upon the handle of my revolver.
Peering through the gloom, I saw the vague outline of a man, a shade blacker than the blackness of the open door.
He stood for an instant, and then he crept forward, crouching, menacing, into the room.
The man seemed to be beside himself with excitement.
His two eyes shone like stars.
His eyes shone like stars.
Her eyes shone like stars.
Tom's eyes shone like stars.
Mary's eyes shone like stars.
He was an elderly man, with a thin, projecting nose, a high, bald forehead, and a huge grizzled moustache.
An opera hat was pushed to the back of his head, and an evening dress shirt-front gleamed out through his open overcoat.
Then, crouching down, he rested the end of the barrel upon the ledge of the open window.
I saw his long moustache droop over the stock and his eye gleam as it peered along the sights.
For an instant he was rigid and motionless. Then his finger tightened on the trigger.
At that instant Holmes sprang like a tiger on to the marksman’s back, and hurled him flat upon his face.
The man was up again in a moment, and with convulsive strength he seized Holmes by the throat, but I struck him on the head with the butt of my revolver, and he dropped again upon the floor.
My comrade blew a shrill call upon a whistle. There was the clatter of running feet upon the pavement, and two policemen in uniform, with one plain-clothes detective, rushed through the front entrance and into the room.
Already a few loiterers had begun to collect in the street.
Holmes stepped up to the window, closed it, and dropped the blinds.
With the brow of a philosopher above and the jaw of a sensualist below, the man must have started with great capacities for good or for evil.
One could not look upon his cruel blue eyes, with their drooping, cynical lids, or upon the fierce, aggressive nose and the threatening, deep-lined brow, without reading Nature’s plainest danger-signals.
He took no heed of any of us, but his eyes were fixed upon Holmes’ face with an expression in which hatred and amazement were equally blended.
“You fiend!” he kept on muttering, “you clever, clever fiend!”
“Ah, Colonel!” said Holmes, arranging his rumpled collar.
With that exception, all has gone as I expected.
"Journeys end in lovers' meetings," as the old play says.
Nothing further you have to say, Mr. Holmes, before we go?
“Well, that’s reasonable enough,” said Lestrade.
Holmes had picked up the powerful air-gun from the floor, and was examining its mechanism. "An admirable and unique weapon," said he, "noiseless and of tremendous power."
That's reasonable enough.
That's a reasonable offer.
What Tom suggested was reasonable.
I knew Von Herder, the blind German mechanic, who constructed it to the order of the late Professor Moriarty.
They sell computers at very reasonable prices at that store.
Our old chambers had been left unchanged.
That's a reasonable concern.
There are several points which I should like to discuss with you.
That's perfectly reasonable.
He was the best shot in India, and I expect that there are few better in London.
Tom is the best shot in Boston.
We waited a reasonable amount of time and then left.
It would've been reasonable for Tom to have done that.
Tom's plan sounded much more reasonable than Mary's.
Tom's plan sounded much more reasonable than Mary's plan.
The police had no reasonable cause to search my car.
He was always a man of iron nerve, and the story is still told in India how he crawled down a drain after a wounded man-eating tiger.
Tom's request seemed reasonable.
It's reasonable to assume that Tom was the one who did that.
Any reasonable person knows that it's not a good idea to do something like that.
We've had reasonable success with this strategy.
I believe that on the day of the murder Adair had discovered that Moran was cheating. Very likely he had spoken to him privately, and had threatened to expose him unless he voluntarily resigned his membership of the club, and promised not to play cards again.
I got this car for a very reasonable price.
Colonel Moran will trouble us no more.
A reasonable person wouldn't have done that.
The famous air-gun of Von Herder will embellish the Scotland Yard Museum, and once again Mr. Sherlock Holmes is free to devote his life to examining those interesting little problems which the complex life of London so plentifully presents.
From the point of view of the criminal expert,” said Mr. Sherlock Holmes, “London has become a singularly uninteresting city since the death of the late lamented Professor Moriarty.”
“I can hardly think that you would find many decent citizens to agree with you,” I answered.
It's just as I suspected.
At the time of which I speak, Holmes had been back for some months, and I at his request had sold my practice and returned to share the old quarters in Baker Street.
Mr. Sherlock Holmes was leaning back in his chair and was unfolding his morning paper in a leisurely fashion, when our attention was arrested by a tremendous ring at the bell, followed immediately by a hollow drumming sound, as if someone were beating on the outer door with his fist.
As the door opened there came a tumultuous rush into the hall, rapid feet clattered up the stair, and an instant later a wild-eyed and frantic young man, pale, dishevelled, and palpitating, burst into the room.
He looked from one to the other of us, and under our gaze of inquiry he became conscious that some apology was needed for this unceremonious entry.
I am the most unfortunate man at this moment in London.
"On what charge do you expect to be arrested?" "Upon the charge of murdering Mr. Jonas Oldacre, of Lower Norwood."
“Dear me,” said he, “it was only this moment at breakfast that I was saying to my friend, Dr. Watson, that sensational cases had disappeared out of our papers.”
Our visitor stretched forward a quivering hand and picked up the Daily Telegraph, which still lay upon Holmes’ knee.
I have been followed from London Bridge Station, and I am sure that they are only waiting for the warrant to arrest me. It will break my mother’s heart—it will break her heart!
He wrung his hands in an agony of apprehension, and swayed backwards and forwards in his chair.
I looked with interest upon this man, who was accused of being the perpetrator of a crime of violence.
He was flaxen-haired and handsome, in a washed-out negative fashion, with frightened blue eyes, and a clean-shaven face, with a weak, sensitive mouth.
His age may have been about twenty-seven, his dress and bearing that of a gentleman.
Mr. Oldacre is a bachelor, fifty-two years of age, and lives in Deep Dene House.
He has had the reputation of being a man of eccentric habits, secretive and retiring.
It is rumoured as we go to press that Mr. John Hector McFarlane has actually been arrested on the charge of the murder of Mr. Jonas Oldacre.
Charred remains have been found among the charcoal ashes of the fire.
The police theory is that a most sensational crime has been committed, that the victim was clubbed to death in his own bedroom, his papers rifled, and his dead body dragged across to the wood-stack, which was then ignited so as to hide all traces of the crime.
The conduct of the criminal investigation has been left in the experienced hands of Inspector Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, who is following up the clues with his accustomed energy and sagacity.
Sherlock Holmes listened with closed eyes and finger-tips together to this remarkable account.
Nothing seemed to go right.
At the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month -- precisely years after fighting halted in the first world war -- leaders from more than nations -- the majority of countries that sent troops or workers to the Western Front -- gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to remember the millions who died in the conflict.
French President Emmanuel Macron, at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier under the arch, lit the eternal flame that is rekindled every night at the memorial engraved with the words: "Here rests a French soldier who died for the nation."
In his address, Macron spoke of the sacrifices of lives made a century ago in the four years of carnage in Europe.
“Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism,” said Macron. “Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism.”
"Old demons are reawakening, ready to sow chaos and death," warned Macron. "History sometimes threatens to repeat its tragic patterns and undermine the legacy of peace we thought we had sealed with the blood of our ancestors."
Macron, later on Sunday, hosted a peace forum, which the German chancellor says is meant to demonstrate efforts “to do everything to bring a more peaceful order to the world, even though we know we still have much work to do."

No soldier from the war is known to still be alive but their voices were present through high school students reading their letters written at the front on this day a century ago.
U.S. Army Capt. Charles Normington wrote that "each soldier had his arms full of French girls, some crying, others laughing; each girl had to kiss every soldier before she would let him pass. There is nowhere on earth I would rather be."

"Finally, the whir of the shells and the whistling of the bullets are over," wrote French infantryman Alfred Roumiguieres.
The four years of battles in trenches was intended – as the British and Americans idealistically insisted – to be the “war to end all wars.” But little more than years later global conflict would again erupt with casualties on an unprecedented scale.
An American delegation led by Chief of Staff General John Kelly and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joe Dunford visited the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial under gray skies and drizzle, paying respect to the nearly 2,war dead buried at the site of the June Battle of Belleau Wood.
Images were broadcast of French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel holding hands at the site in the Compiegne Forest, north of the capital, where allies and defeated Germans signed the agreement that ended the war.
The United States is observing Veterans Day on Sunday, the annual day it stops to remember the millions of men and women who have served in the country's armed forces, often at the sacrifice of their own lives.
In his Veterans Day message, former president Barack Obama tweeted, “To all our veterans and your families: thank you. There's no tribute that can truly match the magnitude of your service and sacrifice.” “But all of us can do our best to live up to the American values of service, responsibility, generosity, and citizenship that you helped defend,” he added.
In the U.S., Veterans Day was originally called “Armistice Day,” to commemorate the end of World War I, but Congress passed a resolution in for an annual observance.
November each year became a national holiday beginning in 1938, with this year's official observance on Monday since the actual date fell on a weekend this year.

Deadly wildfires raged Monday at several sites in California, with authorities saying people have been killed, while another are missing.
In the vast state along the Pacific Ocean, officials said that 150,residents have been displaced as high winds and tinder-dry conditions have helped fuel blazes that have torched more than 1,square kilometers of forest lands, residential communities and business districts.
Twenty-nine of the deaths occurred in a northern California fire that destroyed the town of Paradise and is still only percent contained.
California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency and asked for financial aid from the federal government in Washington.

Like many millennials, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 29, cannot afford to pay the rent in Washington, D.C.
But Ocasio-Cortez isn't your average twenty-something. The New Yorker was just elected to the U.S. Congress, where she will earn an annual salary of $174,000.
Rent has increased percent over the past years, but incomes for younger Americans have only gone up percent.
Almost percent of non-student millennials rely on financial help from family to cover their rents, according to the study.

The night eye caught all, whilst the king slept. Upon awakening he was informed of the treachery afoot.
The king made appropriate adjustments for the vile being. The king knew the being's child like mind would continue to lure him in. The vile being had a taste for that which he could not have and it clouded his sense of reality. He never saw it coming until it was to late. The fear and anger in the vile beings eyes was matched by the king discrete knodding.
The king explained to the being, that only through many years and many mistakes was he able to master such a test. The king faced such adversity his entire life and was underestimated in many a strife. See that is the king's most valuable weapon and allowed the element of surprise and such violence of action to defeat the vile creatures that lurked and hid like cowards.
Never forget about it.
