He who dethrones the idea of law, bids chaos welcome in its stead.
Books are the windows through which the soul looks out.
The love of knowledge comes with reading and grows upon it.
If ever there was a cause, if ever there can be a cause, worthy to be upheld by all of toil or sacrifice that the human heart can endure, it is the cause of Education.
If any man seeks for greatness, let him forget greatness and ask for truth, and he will find both.

“What do you make of that?” said Holmes. “Well, what do you make of it?”
"Is not all this obvious?" "It strikes me, my good Lestrade, as being just a trifle too obvious," said Holmes.
Even though I've quit smoking, I still have the urge to smoke.
No, my dear fellow, I don’t think you can help me.
Even though I've quit smoking, I still crave a cigarette from time to time.
It was late when my friend returned, and I could see, by a glance at his haggard and anxious face, that the high hopes with which he had started had not been fulfilled.
I don't think you can help me.
For an hour he droned away upon his violin, endeavouring to soothe his own ruffled spirits.
I don't think that you can help me.
At last he flung down the instrument, and plunged into a detailed account of his misadventures.
It’s all going wrong, Watson—all as wrong as it can go.
Tom opened the door for us.
I didn't recognize you at first.
Tom walked around the room.

Tom wants to go for a ride.
I don't know where my socks are.
Tom would be a good butler.
I don't like cream in my coffee.
Tom's injury isn't serious.
I don't own one of those things.
I kept a bold face before Lestrade, but, upon my soul, I believe that for once the fellow is on the right track and we are on the wrong. All my instincts are one way, and all the facts are the other.
"You knew him at that time?" said I. "Yes, I knew him well. In fact, he was an old suitor of mine."
Thank Heaven, that I had the sense to turn away from him, and to marry a better, if poorer, man.
I was engaged to him, Mr. Holmes, when I heard a shocking story of how he had turned a cat loose in an aviary, and I was so horrified at his brutal cruelty that I would have nothing more to do with him.
Tom was engaged to Mary at one time.
Did you know Tom at that time?
Everything that could've gone wrong went wrong.
She rummaged in a bureau and produced a photograph of a woman.
The wood-pile was very dry, for it had not rained for a month. It burned like tinder, and by the time she reached the spot, nothing could be seen but flames.
I know it’s all wrong. I feel it in my bones.
There is something that has not come out, and that housekeeper knows it.
There was a sort of sulky defiance in her eyes, which only goes with guilty knowledge.
There’s no good talking any more about it.
Unless we succeed in establishing an alternative theory, this man is lost.
On looking over the bank-book I found that the low state of the balance was principally due to large cheques which have been made out during the last year to Mr. Cornelius.
Is it possible that he has had a hand in the affair?
I do not know how far Sherlock Holmes took any sleep that night, but when I came down to breakfast I found him pale and harassed, his bright eyes the brighter for the dark shadows round them.
An open telegram lay upon the table.
What do you think of this, Watson?
Lestrade met us, his face flushed with victory, his manner grossly triumphant.
A man can't expect always to have it his own way.
With dramatic suddenness he struck a match, and by its light exposed a stain of blood upon the whitewashed wall.
As he held the match nearer, I saw that it was more than a stain. It was the well-marked print of a thumb.
Look at that with your magnifying glass.
“Look at that with your magnifying glass, Mr. Holmes.” “Yes, I am doing so.”
An extraordinary change had come over his face.
An extraordinary change had come over his face. It was writhing with inward merriment.
His two eyes were shining like stars.
His eyes were shining like stars.
Her eyes were shining like stars.
Tom's eyes were shining like stars.
It seemed to me that he was making desperate efforts to restrain a convulsive attack of laughter.
“Dear me! Dear me!” he said at last.
Well, now, who would have thought it?
Some of us are a little too much inclined to be cocksure.
Who made this remarkable discovery?
I am a practical man.
With a confused brain, but with a heart into which some warmth of hope was returning, I accompanied my friend in a walk round the garden.
I accompanied my friend in a walk around the garden.

I assure you, my good Lestrade, that I have an excellent reason for everything that I do.
A door suddenly flew open out of what appeared to be solid wall at the end of the corridor.
A door suddenly flew open out of what appeared to be solid wall at the end of the corridor, and a little, wizened man darted out of it, like a rabbit out of its burrow.
The detective stared at the newcomer with blank amazement.
It was an odious face—crafty, vicious, malignant, with shifty, light-grey eyes and white lashes.
I have done no harm.
You have saved an innocent man’s life, and you have prevented a very grave scandal.
All his life he has longed for vengeance.
All his life he had longed for vengeance.
He determined to swindle his creditors, and for this purpose he paid large cheques to a certain Mr. Cornelius, who is, I imagine, himself under another name.
Mary stood in the moonlight.
Tom stood in the moonlight.
Mary waited for a kiss.
Tom wasn't sure whether he should kiss Mary or not, so he didn't.
Tom wasn't sure if he should kiss Mary or not, so he didn't.
It happened as the frog said.
It happened the way Tom said it did.
It didn't really happen the way Tom said it did.
What specifically are you looking for?
She wanted vengeance because she was not invited.
She turned away without saying a word and left the room.
He stayed completely alone in the castle.
A rusty key was set in the lock.
The boy has made a mistake.
Tom's injury seems serious.
I don't really enjoy doing this.

I don't speak French or English.
We were with Tom yesterday.
I don't want to go to the party.
Why does Tom feel that way?
I wanted to stay in bed all day.
Why does Tom need a hammer?
I was reluctant to say anything.
Why does Tom want all that?
I'm not familiar with the topic.
Why does Tom want all this?

She was an extremely beautiful woman.
She has been married three times.
She can't remember.
She was very motherly.
She never drank in front of her daughter.
Is this a shitpost?
The flowers let him pass without wounding him.
In the castle courtyard he saw the horses sleep.
Everything was so quiet you could hear his breathing.
When he touched her she opened her eyes.
The doves on the roof pulled their little heads out from their wings.
The flies on the wall continued to crawl.
The roast began to roast again.
Tom is a well-known shitposter.
I laughed until I cried. Silly little boy....
After several beers she told him. She said she had no choice. He forgave her, and they made a plan. He would be none the wiser and would play hide-N-seek as if he were still in the game.
She searched for her house key in her bag, but she didn't find it.
He told me his life story.
In America, the people speak English.
In the USA, the people speak English.

I've learned to ignore the pain.
Tom is a cranky old man.
It's going to be very hot today.
None of us did well on the test.
Tom flew to Boston today.
We didn't know what to do first.
Tom took Mary to the clinic.
They know why I left.
They're way too late.
I have captured you, and now you have to work hard for me.
The boy threw a comb behind him.
Then the girl threw a mirror behind her.
I should go home to get my axe.
You have a piece of cake and a bottle of wine.
Don't leave the street, otherwise you'll fall and you'll break the glass.
Look at the beautiful flowers standing here around us.
If you see her, don't forget to say 'good morning'.
He didn't know how malevolent the man was and thus didn't fear him.
"I will do everything right", she swore to her mother.

I have adopted a beautiful dog. Its prior owner was very abusive, and it sometimes wanders. Though it's not the first dog I have adopted, it is more frightened than any of the others. The brutality it endured from its previous owners is unconscionable. It needs discipline, not brutality. A owner who breaks a dog's spirit will never know true love from his dog. It will be fake and submissive. But that kind of owner doesn't really care; for them, a dog is a dog. I will wait days and put a new collar on it, and then it will know that it is safe from its past abusers.

The Word is lost yet it is ever with us. The light that illumines the distant horizon shines in our hearts. "Thou wouldist not seek me hadst thou not found me." We travel afar only to find that which we hunger for at home.
