Love will make men dare to die for their beloved. Of this Alcestis is a monument for she was willing to lay down her life for her husband and so noble did this appear to the gods that they granted her the privilege of returning to earth, but Orpheus, the son of Oeagrus, they sent empty away.

Hymen had been called to bless with his presence the nuptials of Orpheus with Eurydice; but though he attended, he brought no happy omens with him. His very torch smoked and brought tears into their eyes.

Orpheus was permitted to take her away with him on one condition, that he should not turn around to look at her till they should have reached the upper air.

The weapon, as soon as it came within the sound of his lyre, fell harmless at his feet. So did also the stones that they threw at him. But the women raised a scream and drowned the voice of the music, and then the missiles reached him and soon were stained with his blood.
The maniacs tore him limb from limb, and threw his head and his lyre into the river Hebrus, down which they floated, murmuring sad music, to which the shores responded a plaintive symphony.
The Muses gathered up the fragments of his body and buried them at Libethra, where the nightingale is said to sing over his grave more sweetly than in any other part of Greece
His lyre was placed by Jupiter among the stars.
His shade passed a second time to Tartarus, where he sought out his Eurydice and embraced her with eager arms.
They roam the happy fields together now, sometimes he leading, sometimes she; and Orpheus gazes as much as he will upon her, no longer incurring a penalty for a thoughtless glance.

It is naught but an old folk-tale.
It is naught but an old folk-tale, but it has truth hidden at its heart.
When the Three Wise Men rode from the East into the West on that "first, best Christmas night," they bore on their saddle-bows three caskets filled with gold and frankincense and myrrh, to be laid at the feet of the manger-cradled babe of Bethlehem.
Beginning with this old, old journey, the spirit of giving crept into the world's heart.
As the Magi came bearing gifts, so do we also; gifts that relieve want, gifts that are sweet and fragrant with friendship, gifts that breathe love, gifts that mean service, gifts inspired still by the star that shone over the City of David nearly two thousand years ago.
Then hang the green coronet of the Christmas-tree with glittering baubles and jewels of flame; heap offerings on its emerald branches; bring the Yule log to the firing; deck the house with holly and mistletoe, "And all the bells on earth shall ring On Christmas day in the morning."
Have you heard of the great Forest of Burzee?
The Forest of Burzee is mighty and grand and awesome to those who steal beneath its shade.
Coming from the sunlit meadows into the forest's mazes, it seems at first gloomy, then pleasant, and afterward filled with never-ending delights.
For hundreds of years the forest has flourished in all its magnificence, the silence of its inclosure unbroken save by the chirp of busy chipmunks, the growl of wild beasts and the songs of birds.
Yet Burzee has its inhabitants. Nature peopled it in the beginning with Fairies, Knooks, Ryls and Nymphs.
As long as the Forest stands it will be a home, a refuge and a playground to these sweet immortals, who revel undisturbed in its depths.
Civilization has never yet reached Burzee. Will it ever, I wonder?
Have you heard of the great Forest of Burzee? Nurse used to sing of it when I was a child. She sang of the big tree-trunks, standing close together, with their roots intertwining below the earth and their branches intertwining above it; of their rough coating of bark and queer, gnarled limbs; of the bushy foliage that roofed the entire forest, save where the sunbeams found a path through which to touch the ground in little spots and to cast weird and curious shadows over the mosses, the lichens and the drifts of dried leaves.
Once, so long ago our great-grandfathers could scarcely have heard it mentioned, there lived within the great Forest of Burzee a wood-nymph named Necile.
She was closely related to the mighty Queen Zurline, and her home was beneath the shade of a widespreading oak.
Once every year, on Budding Day, when the trees put forth their new buds, Necile held the Golden Chalice of Ak to the lips of the Queen, who drank therefrom to the prosperity of the Forest.
She was a nymph of some importance, and, moreover, it is said she was highly regarded because of her beauty and grace.
It was long ago when the world was new and nymphs were needed to guard the forests and to minister to the wants of the young trees.
Then, on some day not remembered, Necile sprang into being; radiant, lovely, straight and slim as the sapling she was created to guard.
Her hair was the color that lines a chestnut-bur.
Her eyes were blue in the sunlight and purple in the shade.
Her cheeks bloomed with the faint pink that edges the clouds at sunset.
Her lips were full red, pouting and sweet.
For costume, she adopted oak-leaf green.
All the wood-nymphs dress in that color and know no other so desirable.
Her dainty feet were sandal-clad, while her head remained bare of covering other than her silken tresses.
Necile's duties were few and simple.
She kept hurtful weeds from growing beneath her trees and sapping the earth-food required by her charges.
She frightened away the Gadgols, who took evil delight in flying against the tree-trunks and wounding them so that they drooped and died from the poisonous contact.
In dry seasons she carried water from the brooks and pools and moistened the roots of her thirsty dependents.
The weeds learned to avoid the forests where wood-nymphs dwelt.
The loathsome Gadgols no longer dared come nigh.
The trees had become old and sturdy and could bear the drought better than when fresh-sprouted.
Succeeding years became more tiresome and uneventful than the nymph's joyous spirit loved.
The forest-dwellers did not lack amusement.
Each full moon they danced in the Royal Circle of the Queen.
There were also the Feast of Nuts, the Jubilee of Autumn Tintings, the solemn ceremony of Leaf Shedding and the revelry of Budding Day. But these periods of enjoyment were far apart, and left many weary hours between.
But when once she had settled in her mind that life was irksome she had no patience with her condition, and longed to do something of real interest and to pass her days in ways hitherto undreamed of by forest nymphs.
The Law of the Forest alone restrained her from going forth in search of adventure.
Ak is the Master Woodsman of the world; he sees everything, and knows more than the sons of men.
"We live so happily, my fair ones, in our forest glades," said Ak, stroking his grizzled beard thoughtfully, "that we know nothing of the sorrow and misery that fall to the lot of those poor mortals who inhabit the open spaces of the earth."
Often as I pass by the dwelling of some suffering mortal I am tempted to stop and banish the poor thing's misery. Yet suffering, in moderation, is the natural lot of mortals, and it is not our place to interfere with the laws of Nature.
Not long ago, I found four poor children huddled in a wooden hut, slowly freezing to death.
Their parents had gone to a neighboring village for food, and had left a fire to warm their little ones while they were absent. But a storm arose and drifted the snow in their path, so they were long on the road.
In the meantime, the fire went out and the frost crept into the bones of the waiting children.
"Poor things!" murmured the Queen softly. "What did you do?"
I called Nelko, bidding him fetch wood from my forests and breathe upon it until the fire blazed again and warmed the little room where the children lay. Then they ceased shivering and fell asleep until their parents came.
"I am glad you did thus," said the good Queen.
Necile, who had eagerly listened to every word, echoed in a whisper: "I, too, am glad!"
I looked about me and found, close to the forest, a helpless babe, lying quite naked upon the grasses and wailing piteously.
Not far away, screened by the forest, crouched Shiegra, the lioness, intent upon devouring the infant for her evening meal.
"And what did you do, Ak?" asked the Queen, breathlessly.
I commanded Shiegra to lie close to the babe, and to give it her milk to quiet its hunger. And I told her to send word throughout the forest, to all beasts and reptiles, that the child should not be harmed.
"I am glad you did thus," said the good Queen again, in a tone of relief.
The nymph, filled with a strange resolve, had suddenly stolen away from the group.
Swiftly, her lithe form darted through the forest paths until she reached the edge of the forest.
Never until now had she ventured so far.
Necile knew she was breaking the Law, but the thought did not give pause to her dainty feet.
She had decided to see with her own eyes this infant Ak had told of, for she had never yet beheld a child of man.
All the immortals are full-grown; there are no children among them.
Peering through the trees, Necile saw the child lying on the grass.
The child was sleeping sweetly.
The babe was newborn, chubby and pink.
The child was entirely helpless.
While the nymph gazed, the infant opened its eyes, smiled upon her, and stretched out two dimpled arms.
In another instant, Necile had caught the infant to her breast and was hurrying with it through the forest paths.
"There is a strange presence in the Forest," he declared.
Then the Queen and her nymphs turned and saw standing before them Necile, with the sleeping infant clasped tightly in her arms and a defiant look in her deep blue eyes.
"Let me keep the child!" she answered, beginning to tremble and falling on her knees in supplication.
What is your desire, Necile?
Ak, as was his habit when in thought, stroked his grizzled beard slowly.
The nymphs clustered around her and the child that lay asleep in her lap, with expressions of curiosity and delight.
"What shall we call him, Necile?" she asked, smiling. "He must have a name, you know."
He must have a name, you know.
"Let him be called Claus," answered Necile.
Tom traveled the whole world.
Tom was asked to return.
The nymphs clapped their hands in delight.
Necile gathered the softest moss in all the forest for Claus to lie upon.
His thoughts and words were sweet and gentle, for the nymphs knew no evil and their hearts were pure and loving.
The Ryls are required to watch over the flowers and plants, as the nymphs watch over the forest trees.
The brilliant colors possessed by the full-blown flowers are due to the dyes placed in the soil by the Ryls, which are drawn through the little veins in the roots and the body of the plants, as they reach maturity.
The Knooks' duty is to watch over the beasts of the world, both gentle and wild.
The Fairies are the guardians of mankind.
There are instances on record where the Fairies have shown themselves to human beings, and have even conversed with them; but they are supposed to guard the lives of mankind unseen and unknown.
The Fairies are very just and impartial.
The idea had never occurred to Tom.
The idea had never occurred to him.
The idea had never occurred to her.
No forest flower was trampled beneath his feet, lest the friendly Ryls should be grieved.
He never interfered with the beasts of the forest, lest his friends the Knooks should become angry.
To him, the forest was the world.
He had no idea that millions of toiling, striving human creatures existed.
And he was happy and content.
Years pass swiftly in Burzee, for the nymphs have no need to regard time in any way. Even centuries make no change in the dainty creatures; ever and ever they remain the same, immortal and unchanging.
Claus, however, being mortal, grew to manhood day by day.
His stout legs carried him far into the forest's heart, where he gathered supplies of nuts and berries, as well as several sweet and wholesome roots.
I haven't been feeling great since this morning.
She followed him through the forest paths, as did many of her sister nymphs, explaining as they walked all the mysteries of the gigantic wood and the habits and nature of the living things which dwelt beneath its shade.
The language of the beasts became clear to little Claus; but he never could understand their sulky and morose tempers.
Only the squirrels, the mice and the rabbits seemed to possess cheerful and merry natures.
He could sing the songs of the bees, recite the poetry of the wood-flowers and relate the history of every blinking owl in the forest.
Bid good bye, for a time, to Necile and her sisters; for you shall accompany me on my journey through the world.
Necile wept for the first time in her life, and clung to the boy's neck as if she could not bear to let him go.
Until now, he had thought himself the only one of his kind upon the earth.
Then the vast forest seemed to fall away from their feet, and the youth found himself passing swiftly through the air at a great height.
One of the first laws of the Forest is obedience, and Claus had no thought of disobeying the Master's wish.
"So long as you hold fast to my girdle, you will remain unseen by all mankind, though seeing clearly yourself.
The immortals are few; but the mortals are many.
Ragged little ones rolled in the dust of the streets, playing with scraps and pebbles. Other children, gaily dressed, were propped upon cushions and fed with sugar-plums. Yet the children of the rich were not happier than those playing with the dust and pebbles, it seemed to Claus.
"Childhood is the time of man's greatest content," said Ak. "'Tis during these years of innocent pleasure that the little ones are most free from care."
The difference in the wealth of the parents determines the lot of the child. Some are carefully tended and clothed in silks and dainty linen; others are neglected and covered with rags.
"Then why, if man must perish, is he born?" demanded the boy.
Why, if man must perish, is he born?
Everything perishes except the world itself.
While life lasts everything on earth has its use. The wise seek ways to be helpful to the world, for the helpful ones are sure to live again.
Much of this Claus failed to understand fully, but a longing seized him to become helpful to his fellows.
He remained grave and thoughtful while they resumed their journey.

He closed the yawning gates of hell; The bars from heaven’s high portals fell; Let hymns of praise His triumphs tell! Alleluia!
Lord, by the stripes which wounded Thee, From death’s dread sting Thy servants free, That we may live, and sing to Thee: Alleluia!
Art is long, and Time is fleeting, And our hearts, though stout and brave, Still, like muffled drums, are beating Funeral marches to the grave. In the world’s broad field of battle, In the bivouac of Life, Be not like dumb, driven cattle! Be a hero in the strife!
