A new report finds most adolescents around the world do not get enough physical activity on a daily basis to be healthy and to stay healthy as adults.
Data for this study was collected from 1.million adolescents across countries.
The report says the biggest gender gaps are seen in the United States and Ireland where percent more girls than boys were physically inactive.
The World Health Organization recommends adolescents do moderate or vigorous exercises for one hour every day of the week to stay fit.
Guthold says any kind of physical activity is good. This could include walking or biking to school, team sports, dancing, active domestic chores, physical education and planned exercise.
Where he will go is still unclear.
The study finds young people everywhere in the world do not exercise enough.
Data shows that percent of girls and percent of boys do not meet the current WHO recommendations of at least one hour of physical activity a day.
“We have had this electronic revolution that seems to have changed adolescents’ movement patterns and encourages them to sit more, to be less active, to drive more, walk less, be less active in general and then be more involved in digital play rather than the active play,” she said.
Schools should encourage physical education and get students to be more active in competitive and non-competitive sports.

Ambassadors and aides from all members of the European Union joined forces last week with volunteers from Casey Trees, a local conservation group, to plant trees in a Washington city park, hoping to earn goodwill and make a symbolic point with their labor.
Trees soak up and store some of the excess planet-warming carbon dioxide that human activities produce.
"The best time to plant a tree is years ago," the enthusiastic planters were told by Stavros Lambrinidis, ambassador of the European Union (EU) to the United States, as they gathered in a sunny corner of Washington's Rock Creek Park. "The second best time is now."
The best time to plant a tree is years ago. The second best time is now.
"Every single thing every single citizen does is as important as the grand things that governments do," he said, noting that the EU has committed itself to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
The tree-planting effort was led by Ambassador Kirsti Kauppi of Finland, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency. She said her nation has a special affinity for trees, given that 70% of its surface is covered by woods and that Finns basically "live in and outside of the forest."
Even as Finland is often imagined as a land of ice and snow, the trees in her Nordic country "have no problem surviving the winter," she said. "Then we have a very nice summer, a lot of sunlight. That's when the trees grow."

Celynn's favorite part of the event was not, as she anticipated, the pie. "I had high expectations," she said diplomatically, clearing orange and yellow decorations off the tables at the end of the evening. "But it was still edible."
Minorities make up the majority of the latest group of U.S. college students to be named Rhodes Scholars, and the class includes the first transgender woman selected for the prestigious program.
Paul Ziemkiewicz pulls off a winding country road at a stream about kilometers east of Morgantown, West Virginia. The water is about as acidic as vinegar, he says. It's "100% fatal" to aquatic life.
"I doubt that even deer want to drink the water," he added. "it's useless."
This pollution, known as acid mine drainage, contaminates roughly 4,kilometers (2,miles) of West Virginia waterways. It's a legacy of more than a century of coal mining in the region.
Ziemkiewicz grew up in Appalachia, outside Pittsburgh, where, he said, "acid mine drainage was just way of life. Streams tended to be orange."
For the last years, he has been working to clean up Appalachia's acidified waterways. Ziemkiewicz directs the West Virginia University Water Research Institute.
Now, he's found an unexpected silver lining in these polluted streams. Or, perhaps more accurately, a neodymium lining.
Ziemkiewicz discovered minerals called rare earth metals are dissolved in the acidic water. These elements make some key modern tech work.
Neodymium is used in powerful magnets in wind turbines and electric vehicles. It makes the tiny magnets in cell phone speakers possible.
Thanksgiving in the U.S. is right around the corner.
Historically, Thanksgiving has meant big profits for cranberry farmers as the fruits of their labor appeared on traditional Thanksgiving tables across the country. Crashing prices over the past decade have sent farmers looking elsewhere to make ends meet.
Farmers have grown cranberries in this Massachusetts bog for generations.
Business is not what it used to be.
In September 1789, members of America’s first Congress approached the nation’s first president, George Washington, and asked him to call for a national Thanksgiving.
That seemingly benign request ignited a furor in Congress over presidential powers and states’ rights.
Critics had two main concerns with the idea of a presidential proclamation to declare a national Thanksgiving.
First, some viewed Thanksgiving as a religious holiday, which put it outside of the purview of the president.
Secondly, opponents of the measure believed the president did not have the authority to call a national Thanksgiving because that was a matter for governors.
It was a challenging time for the young nation.
America had won the Revolutionary War but the country — made up of the former colonies — was not fully unified yet.
Calling a national Thanksgiving was a way to bring Americans together.
In the end, Washington did issue a proclamation, the first presidential proclamation ever, calling for a national “day of public thanksgiving and prayer.”
The president came up with a solution designed to appease the opposition.
When he issued the proclamation, he sent copies of that to governors of each of the states, at the time, and asked them to call a national Thanksgiving on the day that Washington specified, the last Thursday of November,” says Melanie Kirkpatrick, author of “Thanksgiving: The Holiday at the Heart of the American Experience.”
As president, Thomas Jefferson refused to issue Thanksgiving proclamations, even though he had done so as governor of Virginia.
After Madison, no U.S. president issued a Thanksgiving proclamation until Abraham Lincoln.
Abraham Lincoln issued a Thanksgiving proclamation in the middle of the U.S. Civil War in in an effort to unify the country.
The Battle of Gettysburg had been fought a few months earlier.
It was becoming clear that the Union was going to win.
Every family in America was deeply affected by that terrible war.
He asked the people to come together as one, with one heart and one voice, to celebrate the holiday
It was Franklin Delano Roosevelt who stirred the pot again in 1939, by moving Thanksgiving to the third Thursday in November. Up until then, Americans had marked the holiday on the last Thursday in November, a date first specified by Lincoln. The new date was Roosevelt's bid to lengthen the Christmas shopping season and boost the nation’s economic recovery after the Great Depression.
Learning is one thing and common sense is another.
The divide over when to celebrate the holiday was so deep that half of the states adopted the new day, while the other half stuck to the traditional day.
Roosevelt eventually reversed his decision, and Congress ended the long national debate over Thanksgiving in by passing a law making the fourth Thursday in November a legal holiday.
Today, Thanksgiving continues to unify millions of Americans who gather to celebrate the holiday with family and friends.
Many will serve traditional foods like turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce.
George Washington made a point of declaring that Thanksgiving should be celebrated by people of all faiths, a distinction that still resonates for Americans, including immigrants marking their first Thanksgiving.
Every year in November, Americans get a day off to give thanks.
The Thanksgiving Day holiday originated centuries ago, with a harvest celebration in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1621.
For many Americans, the holiday is also a time to celebrate the arrival of the first immigrants to the New World.
Historians say it is important to remember that without the help of the Wampanoag tribe, Europeans back in those days may not have survived to celebrate Thanksgiving.
The first year on the American continent was extremely difficult for the pilgrims and settlers.
The settlers arrived too late in the year to grow their own crops.
Many died of hunger and cold.

Pope Francis on Tuesday closed his visit to Japan by telling students at a Catholic university of the need to work toward a "hope-filled future" that is more inclusive by addressing the disconnects in society.
In his address at Sophia University, the pope said he sensed in Japan a desire to create a more humane, compassionate and merciful society.
The pope also cited a "love for nature" as a typical aspect of Asian cultures and expressed a need to protect the planet.
Pope Francis placed a wreath during his visit to the Martyrs' Monument at Nishizaka Hill, in Nagasaki, Japan.
In Nagasaki Sunday, Pope Francis called on political leaders to renounce nuclear weapons and abandon the arms race.
The pope has said it has long been a dream of his to visit Japan, and that he had longed to be sent there as a missionary more than years ago.
Out of Japan's million residents, an estimated 440,are Catholic.
Before traveling to Japan, the pope visited Thailand to preach a message of religious tolerance and peace.

There are certain times of the year when we stop and think about all the things that make us happy or bring us joy. Some people even make a list of these things. In English, we have a saying for this: to count your blessings.
When we count our blessings, we note all the wonderful things in our lives. This helps us to appreciate how good life is.
Thanksgiving is a time when many Americans count their blessings.
The United States observes this holiday on the fourth Thursday in November.
Counting your blessings is important. It shows that you are grateful.
Gratitude is a feeling of appreciation or thanks.
When people count their blessings, they can say it like this: "I am thankful for my family. I am thankful for my friends. I am thankful for my health."
It is better to be grateful for our blessings than to take them for granted.
When we take something for granted, we do not appreciate it. Sometimes we are not appreciative of our good fortune and blessings until they are gone.
In English, the word “blessing” has at least two meanings. As we said, a blessing is something that brings you happiness or helps you. To religious people, a blessing is approval and help from a higher source -- God.
If a young man wants to marry a young woman, he may want to first get her family’s blessing.
So, let’s say a friend of yours is angry about a flat tire on his car. But then he stops and thinks for a minute and says, “Well, at least I have a car. I should count myself lucky and give thanks for small blessings.”
A mixed blessing is something that is both good and bad.
Being really beautiful can be a mixed blessing.
Being really beautiful can be a mixed blessing. On one hand, you look great and may be treated really well by some people. On the other hand, you look great and may be treated badly by other people.

Several koalas have been rescued from the fires.
Dozens of fires continue to burn across eastern Australia.
Experts say it is impossible to know the impact on native wildlife.
A video of an Australian woman picking up an injured koala from a bushfire was widely viewed on social media.
The animal later died at a wildlife hospital.
David Lindenmayer, a professor of ecology at the Australian National University, says droughts and fires can decimate koala populations.
Scientists fear that koalas could be heading toward extinction by if the destruction of their habitat continues.
There are large and thriving populations of koalas in southern Australia.
In parts of the states of Victoria and South Australia marsupial numbers are considered to be overabundant.
Valuable trees are being damaged by too many leaf-eating koalas.

Tom has a Wikipedia page.
In 2018, a wildfire, caused by electrical transmission lines, destroyed approximately 90% of the northern California town of Paradise.
At the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains in Northern California, the deadliest fire in California history burned a year ago and destroyed 90% of the town of Paradise.
The fire killed people.
Over the course of a year, much of the burned debris has been removed.
Many of the burnt trees have been cut down.
Empty lots remain where homes used to stand.
Paradise resident Lori Hornback walked through one of the empty lots, with only a gray concrete slab left of what was once her family homestead. As she looked at the brown dirt and empty space around her and remembered what used to be here, her heart broke.
"This is where I brought my kids home. That's where they learned how to ride a bike," said Hornback as she fought back tears.
Most of the fire survivors are scattered, living in other towns and cities.
There are a few people, however, who have moved back to Paradise, now living in mobile homes on their empty lots and dreaming of a day when the town is vibrant again.
"I ran out without any shoes, ran out without anything because things were exploding all the way around us," Hornback said.
After evacuating their homes, she and her family sought refuge in a shelter for two days.
Then, the Hornbacks met a stranger, a cattle rancher who invited them to stay on her property.
The rancher, whom Hornback described as their hero, shared Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners with them and even gave them Christmas gifts.
"She came to our aid whenever we needed help the most," said Hornback, who now considers the rancher a part of the family.
Eventually, Hornback's family bought a house in Paradise that had been spared by the fire.
Twelve people now live under her roof, including her two grown children, grandchildren, in-laws and other relatives.
This is where we were raised.
The town was nestled in a forest of tall trees.
Jon Hornback, who owns a construction company wants to be a part of the rebuilding process.
With much of the trees burned and gone, Lori Hornback said she has quite a view of the ridge and valley around her from the upstairs porch of her new home.
At sunset, she can see an expansive sky that is brilliant pink and orange.
At night, she can see the stars.

If I met a dozen individuals during that month who were not going to Europe shortly, I have no distinct remembrance of it now.
I was introduced to the young gentleman who was to be my roommate.
I found him to be intelligent, cheerful of spirit, unselfish, full of generous impulses, patient, considerate, and wonderfully good-natured.

Passengers were arriving and hurrying on board.
The vessel’s decks were encumbered with trunks and valises.
Groups of excursionists, arrayed in unattractive traveling costumes, were moping about in a drizzling rain and looking as droopy and woebegone as so many molting chickens.
I was up early that Sabbath morning.

I was greatly surprised to see so many elderly people.

The sea was very rough.
At one moment the bowsprit was taking a deadly aim at the sun in midheaven, and at the next it was trying to harpoon a shark in the bottom of the ocean.
By some happy fortune, I was not seasick.
We all like to see people seasick when we are not, ourselves.

To reason and be mistaken, is that imposture?
Even a sophist who deceives without deceiving himself is not yet an impostor, as long as he confines himself to the authority of reason, even though he abuses it.
According to the Apostle Paul, the gift of prophecy is the most important gift from the Holy Spirit.
An impostor wants to be believed on his word; he wants to make authority by himself.
An impostor is a cheat who wants to impose on others for his profit; and where, I beg you, is my profit in this affair?
