Two new studies suggest that college graduates entering the U.S. job market might not work in the field they studied. They also might change jobs and careers more often than earlier generations, presenting challenges and difficulties in an economy that is experiencing disruption.

Employers have more skilled workers to choose from than ever before, meaning almost anyone can be replaced.
Okahana and Koc agree that in the past, the job outcomes for those with a doctoral degree, or Ph.D., were much clearer.
Ph.Ds require an intense level of expertise â so much expertise that most Ph.D holders once were almost guaranteed jobs as university professors or researchers.
Few Ph.D. holders who graduated years ago changed jobs recently, and most found their current jobs within three years of graduating.
This wasn't true for Ph.D. holders who graduated eight years ago, and even less likely for those who graduated in the past three years. Also, the majority of career moves for these two groups were away from higher education and into business, government and nonprofit industries.
Okahana, Koc and Coffey all said colleges and universities must support students in growth and change.
Colleges should urge students to take classes outside their field of study and seek out work experience in areas of interest to them.
Employers should look to fill positions with individuals who might not have studied the subjects normally expected for those jobs.

In Cameroonâs port city of Douala, most used cooking oil from hotels and restaurants was once dumped down the drain, where it fouled up plumbing systems and caused pollution.
Cameroonian chemist Martial Gervais Oden-Bella makes soap and detergents by turning a toxic ingredient ecologically friendly.
Oden-Bella began collecting used cooking oil in to convert into cleaning products. It's now a business that produces kilograms of soap and two tons of liquid detergent per month.
Even small businesses like donut maker Adeline Monkam have joined in recycling their oil. She says in the past she used to dump the used oil. But people told her that it's polluting the environment, says Monkam, and that she can recycle it. So, she doesnât dump it out anymore.
Water and climate experts from across Asia are stressing the need to work with nature, rather than against it, to save the continent's "disappearing deltas," home to some million people.
Mounting research blames a confluence of rising sea levels driven by global warming and the damming and dredging of key rivers and their tributaries for the rapid sinking and shrinking of Asia's seven major delta systems, from the Indus in Pakistan to the Pearl in China.
The experts say swelling cities are adding to the pressure by weighing down the deltas and sucking up groundwater.
The seven deltas alone host of the world's megacities, including Bangkok, where the experts are gathered this week, parts of which are sinking by centimeters a year.

Losing the deltas will not only erase some of the world's most diverse ecosystems, but drive mass migration, deplete vital farmland and disrupt some of Asia's most dynamic business hubs.
The Pearl River Delta, which empties into the South China Sea past Hong Kong, has been dubbed the "world's workshop" for its abundance of busy factories.
In Vietnam, forecasters say million people will have to leave the Mekong River Delta, the country's rice bowl, by 2050.
"These are some of the most vulnerable places to climate change and change across river systems, but they are also the home for a number of us who live here, they are also the breadbasket of the world that feeds a number of the countries that depend on them," said Kavita Prakash-Mani, global conservation director for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).
"So while we are worried about numerous ecosystems around the world, we really need to be putting special attention on our delta systems and the wetlands and all the other ecosystems they support," she added.
The environmental protection group and others are pushing the idea of "building with nature," where nature is used to cope with climate change â think mangrove seeding to cushion coastal communities from floods â and development falls in step with the natural world's rhythms.
"Politics thinks only to four years, but this is years, years. How do we ask them to think for the future, for the young generation?" he said.
Not only do women already earn cents for every dollar a man makes, but they also pay more for personal products and services like razors, shampoo, haircuts and clothes.
This so-called âpink taxâ follows a woman from the cradle to the grave.
The New York City DCA analyzed almost items in product categories and found that items for female consumers cost more than products for men across of those categories.
Overall, womenâs products cost 7% more than similar products for men.
Women pay more than men for comparable personal care products 56% of the time.

âI have no doubt that it's real,â says Surina Khan, CEO of the Womenâs Foundation of California. âWe just have to go to any store, and you can see that, let's say, a pink razor blade versus a blue one that men use, the pink one costs more. Haircuts cost more. Women's clothing cost more. It's definitely present and part of our reality.â
Horwitz also says the real problem is that girls and women are socialized to want the pink items.
âThere is no reason why women shouldn't be able to walk into the drugstore and buy the men's razors. Right?â he says. âAnd if they did, and if they were clear that they didn't care, there wouldn't be a more expensive women's version.â

I'm looking for a list of high-frequency French words.
The friendship between Winston Lord, who was born to wealth and privilege, and Leslie Gelb, who was not, started when Lordâs wife and Gelb were students at Tufts University in Massachusetts. It ended in August when Gelb died.
We go back years.
He was quite a man.
While Lord was born to a wealthy family in New York City that was part of the Pillsbury flour empire, Gelb grew up in the suburbs to an immigrant family.
Lord admits that on the outset, judging from the two menâs backgrounds, one might wonder how they could become the best of friends.
âWe have a saying in America: born on the third base,â Lord says of their divergent beginnings.
I was born on Park Avenue, with a silver spoon in my mouth.
His friend, meanwhile, had come from a poor immigrant family who worked at his parentsâ grocery store, and as a parking attendant and a dishwasher while in college.
âI think we both did quite well, but he started out with no advantages, whereas I started out with tremendous advantages," Lord said.
Leslie Gelb watches sports on a TV with his cat Wiley.
Leslie later lost his sight in both eyes and had to settle on listening to TV sports broadcasts. He continued his passion for reading by listening to audio books.
âWe both put family above every other consideration as the most important, starting with our wives,â Lord said
Then, of course, weâre both sports fans!
"He loved the Yankees. I hate the Yankees! I like the New York Mets," Lord said.
Gelb married his wife, Judith, in 1959, despite her parentsâ reservations about his lackluster roots.
âI donât want to be pompous or exaggerate, but I believe our strength is diversity, including the strengthening of our society through immigrants, the fact that people from different economic, ethnic and social backgrounds can not only live together but become, in our case, extremely close friends," he said.
âThis man had every conceivable physical ailment toward the end, yet he never complained,â Lord said, sending his friend off in a note of admiration.
He was in constant pain, he couldnât see very well, and yet he always looked at the positive side of things.

That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length, Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three planes, each at right angles to the others.
But some philosophical people have been asking why three dimensions particularlyâwhy not another direction at right angles to the other three?âand have even tried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry.
Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month or so ago.
You know how on a flat surface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could represent one of fourâif they could master the perspective of the thing.
âI think so,â murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words.
âYes, I think I see it now,â he said after some time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.

Climate change, pollution and fishing are causing irreversible damage to New Zealand's marine environment and putting many birds and mammals at risk of extinction, according to a new report from the nationâs Ministry for the Environment.
New Zealand's coastline, which stretches for about 15,kilometers, is also under increasing pressure from development and shipping.
Agriculture, forestry and urbanization are increasing the amount of sediment, chemicals and plastics flowing into the oceans, and contaminating the coastline.
The report said percent of the country's seabirds and about a quarter of its marine mammals are threatened with extinction, and that percent of New Zealand's fish stocks had been overfished.
The sea is a receiving environment for what happens on the land, so our activities on land from the mountains to the sea are having an impact on what we are seeing in the marine environment.
The report also confirmed that New Zealand's sea temperature had risen and was consistent with the global average.
The report also found sea levels were rising faster than before.
There was a warning, too, that New Zealand could expect more frequent marine heat waves, similar to those in and 2018, and ocean acidification.
The next official marine environment report is due in three years.

Charlie Chan and Fu Manchu may have been Chinese characters, but they were largely played by Caucasian actors made up to look Asian.
Chinese American actress Anna Mae Wong wanted to play the female lead in âThe Good Earth,â but she did not get the role. âThe reason why Anna Mae Wong wasnât cast was because of this production law that was part of Hollywood.

As another of our friends has said, translation is not about replacing one language with others. Translation will, on the contrary, help the language to enter the scientific field so that it can be promoted again and again. We should open our eyes: there is a huge difference between a translated language, which can be adopted, and an orphaned language whose mere diffusion would constrain it, even if that were not the original intention.

Thereâs a familiar trend of fast food chains like KFC and Burger King entering developing countries, where citizens start to see obesity rates increase amid all the new junk food options.
More Vietnamese citizens are looking for food products that are healthful.
More Vietnamese citizens are looking for food products that are healthful -- only to end up with products that are anything but that.
The problem is not that Vietnamese are eating large amounts of candy and ice cream. Instead, theyâre buying products like fruit juices and yogurt, not realizing that all the added sugar may outweigh the health benefits of the fruit.
Products are packaged in labels that appeal to citizensâ health goals.
This is part of a broader change across Vietnam, where companies are selling more ready-to-eat meals and processed foods to citizens who used to buy vegetables and eggs directly from farms.
The change is leading to obvious business opportunities.
The Nutifood Nutrition Food Joint Stock Company recently got an expected debt rating of B+ from Fitch Ratings, which predicts the company will profit from more Vietnamese buying health foods.
Today however, obesity is a bigger problem than undernourishment, having increased percent from to -- the highest in Southeast Asia.
Vietnamese citizens are increasingly replacing their fruit with juice, not realizing that all the added sugar contained in juices could outweigh health benefits.
Companies like Pepsi and McDonaldâs have tried to put the focus on exercise, rather than diet, for good health.
Naturally active lifestyles are decreasing in Vietnam, as people move from the countryside to the cities, and from hard labor to office jobs.
Citizens often get on their motorbikes to drive just one block.
Walking in the cities, with 100-degree weather and few sidewalks, is hard.
Citizens use new Uber-like services to have drinks or meals delivered.
Researchers agree exercise and diet are both important, but the latter has a bigger impact on health.
It is one thing to eat unhealthful food, while not caring about the effects. It is quite another thing to eat unhealthful food, however, because one thinks itâs nutritional.
The growing health concern in Vietnam has to do with not just nutrition, but also air pollution, water quality, and clean supply chains.
A Nielsen survey showed health became the top concern of Vietnamese citizens in the second quarter, surpassing job security, cost of living, and work-life balance.
The South Poleâs ozone hole is currently the smallest on record since it was first detected in the 1980s, according to NASA.
âThatâs really good news,â NASA scientist Paul Newman said. âThat means more ozone over the hemisphere, less ultraviolet radiation at the surface.â
Ozone in the stratosphere absorbs some of the sunâs harmful ultraviolet radiation.
Ultraviolet radiation can cause skin cancer, cataracts, suppress immune systems and damage plants.
In a world where everyoneâs life was recorded, no one would ever lose their car keyâ¦ If you forgot where you dropped it, you would just play the recording and voilÃ !
âItâs important to recognize that what weâre seeing this year is due to warmer stratospheric temperatures,â Newman said. âItâs not a sign that atmospheric ozone is suddenly on a fast track to recovery.â
Chlorine in the air needs cold temperatures in the stratosphere and clouds to convert into a form of the chemical that eats ozone, Newman said. The clouds go away when it warms up.
Man-made chlorine compounds, which can last in the air for years, damage the ozone, creating a gap.
The international Montreal Protocol banned many of the chlorine compounds used in refrigerants and aerosols, like hairspray, to lessen the damage. Since then, the size of the ozone hole has slowly declined but remains large enough to produce significant ozone loss.
Scientists project the Antarctic ozone to recover back to its level around 2070.
A major pharmaceutical company and three of the biggest drug distributors in the U.S. have reached a $million settlement with two counties in Ohio to avoid a trial over their role in the deadly opioid addiction crisis gripping America.

Once darkness falls every Oct. 31, American children dress up in costumes and go from house to house.
Each time a front door opens, they call out, âTrick or treat!â
The kids are usually rewarded with small pieces of packaged candy.
Decades ago, people handed out homemade treats, but todayâs parents worry about such offerings since they are more easily tampered with than store-bought candy.
Halloween may have evolved from spooky origins in England, Ireland and Scotland â where the Celts believed the dead could walk among the living during the transition between the seasons â but in America, Halloween is now mostly about candy, costumes and pumpkins.
Tom and Mary have seven children.
Tom and Mary have seven grandchildren.
Tom and Mary have three children and seven grandchildren.
Eighty-five percent of Americans plan to celebrate Halloween.
While most kids might demand a new costume to wear on the big night, almost half of American adults surveyed say theyâll recycle old costumes rather than spend money on a new one.
Google says its most-searched costume terms this year include the creepy clown from the âItâ movie, followed by witch, Spider-Man, dinosaur, Descendants (from a Disney television movie) and clown.
Pumpkins also play a significant role in Halloween traditions.
Many houses place carved pumpkins on their front doorsteps.
A significant number of those pumpkins will come from the state of Illinois, which harvests the largest share of pumpkin acreage of all the states.
Every state grows some pumpkins, but between and 2018, the highest-producing states were Illinois, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Texas and California.
Farmers in those five top pumpkin-producing states harvested more than billion pounds of pumpkins in 2018. Of that, more than half came from Illinois.
There are different varieties of pumpkins, but American growers mainly produce the Howden, the type of gourd used at Halloween to make jack-o'-lanterns.
Todayâs American men are working less during their prime years than they did in the 1960s, with the biggest drop in employment among less-educated men.
In 1969, 96% of men between the ages of and participated in the labor force. By 2015, that rate had fallen to under 89%.
The decline in manufacturing jobs has hit men and women without a college degree the hardest.
Experts suggest that the rise in incarceration, and the growth in the number of people with prison records, negatively contribute to the ability of some of these non-working men to get a job.
Twenty-four percent of the people in group one [men born between to 1964], almost one-in-four, didn't work because they were in prison.
Researchers have also studied the possible impact of the opioid epidemic on labor force participation.
More than people in the United States die each day after abusing opioids.
Opioid overdoses caused more than 42,deaths in 2016.
Solutions for tackling the problem could include making sure young people are educated to acquire skills that will serve them well in the labor market.

Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.
If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.

This college attracts both native and non-native people from across the country â and overseas â who wish to explore their artistic abilities while learning more about the diverse range of native cultures in America.

Experts warn that climate change is speeding up melting on Earth's frozen peaks, threatening the planet's long-term water supply.
The more than global mountain experts attending the first High Mountain Summit warn time is running out for the world's glaciers.
Scientists say Swiss glaciers have lost percent of their volume in the past five years.
The disappearance of hundreds of small glaciers in the Alps was dramatized when hundreds of mourners recently attended what was dubbed a "funeral" to mark the loss of Switzerland's Pizol glacier.
Canadian John Pomeroy, a water resources and climate change expert, said the loss of water resources in mountain ranges around the world is devastating the communities in those areas and destabilizing vast populations downstream.
Around half of humanity relies upon water and rivers that originate in the high mountains. And, so this is used for irrigation. It is used for power production, hydroelectricity. It is used for our urban and community water supplies and it provides essential water for ecosystems from the mountaintop down to the sea.
Pomeroy added the rapidly melting mountain glaciers are contributing to rising sea levels.
Cities along the ocean such as Miami, Venice and Jakarta already are in big trouble.
In the Western U.S., percent of the water supplies are from the high mountains and they drive the economy.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which measures the impact of global warming, predicts snow cover, glaciers and permafrost will continue to decline in almost all regions throughout this century.
The summit is calling for urgent action to support more sustainable development in both high-mountain areas and downstream. That will involve disaster risk reduction measures, better early warning systems, climate change adaptation and investment in infrastructure to make communities safer.

Thus spake Zarathustra.

"We hoped that the gene discovery would someday lead to effective treatments for children and adults with cystic fibrosis," Francis Collins wrote. "Now, years later, that time has come."

Those born with the disease are expected to live only into their 40s.

âIn France, Hung worked as a dishwasher in restaurants,â his father told VOA. âBut he got back pain after a while doing the work. Hung told me he wanted to go to England as friends told him that working in a nail spa is more comfortable and he may get better pay.â
Le says he wanted his son to stay home and get married, but Hung was determined to go abroad.
Theyâre taking these dangerous routes and itâs likely theyâre still going to continue to come because thereâs so much to be gained from their migration here to the UK.
The latest tragedy may put off some migrants from taking risky journeys in the short term. However, as long as there are no legal routes to Britain for low-skilled migrants and the market for cheap, black-market labor remains high, the demand for illegal people-smugglers will continue to grow.

My fellow citizens, tonight is my last opportunity to speak to you from the Oval Office as your President. I am profoundly grateful to you for twice giving me the honor to serve, to work for you and with you to prepare our Nation for the 21st century.
This has been a time of dramatic transformation, and you have risen to every new challenge. You have made our social fabric stronger, our families healthier and safer, our people more prosperous. You, the American people, have made our passage into the global information age an era of great American renewal.
In all the work I have done as Presidentâevery decision I have made, every executive action I have taken, every bill I have proposed and signedâI've tried to give all Americans the tools and conditions to build the future of our dreams in a good society with a strong economy, a cleaner environment, and a freer, safer, more prosperous world.
I have steered my course by our enduring values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, a community of all Americans.
I have sought to give America a new kind of Government, smaller, more modern, more effective, full of ideas and policies appropriate to this new time, always putting people first, always focusing on the future.
Our economy is breaking records with more than million new jobs, the lowest unemployment in years, the highest homeownership ever, the longest expansion in history.
More than million children have health insurance now, and more than million Americans have been lifted out of poverty.
At this remarkable moment in history, more people live in freedom than ever before. Our alliances are stronger than ever. People all around the world look to America to be a force for peace and prosperity, freedom and security.
As we become ever more diverse, we must work harder to unite around our common values and our common humanity. We must work harder to overcome our differences, in our hearts and in our laws.
We must embrace boldly and resolutely that duty to lead - to stand with our allies in word and deed and to put a human face on the global economy, so that expanded trade benefits all peoples in all nations, lifting lives and hopes all across the world.
I refer, of course, to the treaty to ban nuclear tests in the atmosphere, outer space, and under water--concluded by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States--and already signed by nearly countries.
The world has not escaped from the darkness. The long shadows of conflict and crisis envelop us still. But we meet today in an atmosphere of rising hope, and at a moment of comparative calm.
I have come to salute the United Nations and to show the support of the American people for your daily deliberations.
Our concepts of the world are different. No service is performed by failing to make clear our disagreements. A central difference is the belief of the American people in self-determination for all people.
We believe that the people of Cuba must be free to secure the fruits of the revolution that have been betrayed from within and exploited from without.
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; "and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together."
With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.
And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado. Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.
And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: Free at last! Free at last!
But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.
Life in freedom is not easy, and democracy is not perfect. But we never needed to build a wall to keep our people with us and prevent them from going elsewhere.

Having thus imparted to you my sentiments, as they have been awakened by the occasion which brings us together, I shall take my present leave; but not without resorting once more to the benign parent of the human race, in humble supplication that since he has been pleased to favour the American people, with opportunities for deliberating in perfect tranquility, and dispositions for deciding with unparellelled unanimity on a form of Government, for the security of their Union, and the advancement of their happiness; so his divine blessing may be equally conspicuous in the enlarged views, the temperate consultations, and the wise measures on which the success of this Government must depend.
Sixteen hours ago an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima, an important Japanese Army base. That bomb had more power than 20,tons of T.N.T. It had more than two thousand times the blast power of the British "Grand Slam" which is the largest bomb ever yet used in the history of warfare.
With this bomb we have now added a new and revolutionary increase in destruction to supplement the growing power of our armed forces. In their present form these bombs are now in production and even more powerful forms are in development. It is an atomic bomb. It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe. The force from which the sun draws its power has been loosed against those who brought war to the Far East.
President von Weizsacker has said: "The German question is open as long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed." Today I say: As long as this gate is closed, as long as this scar of a wall is permitted to stand, it is not the German question alone that remains open, but the question of freedom for all mankind. Yet I do not come here to lament. For I find in Berlin a message of hope, even in the shadow of this wall, a message of triumph.
I'm German by passport, Hessian by birth and a Frankfurter by God's grace.

Hand in hand with freedom of speech goes the power to be heard, to share in the decisions of government which shape men's lives. Everything that makes man's life worthwhile-family, work, education, a place to rear one's children and a place to rest one's head -all this depends on decisions of government; all can be swept away by a government which does not heed the demands of its people.
They are the essence of our differences with communism today. I am unalterably opposed to communism because it exalts the state over the individual and the family, and because of the lack of freedom of speech, of protest, of religion, and of the press, which is the characteristic of totalitarian states. The way of opposition to communism is not to imitate its dictatorship, but to enlarge individual freedom, in our own countries and all over the globe.
So the road toward equality of freedom is not easy, and great cost and danger march alongside us. We are committed to peaceful and nonviolent change, and that is important for all to understand though all change is unsettling. Still, even in the turbulence of protest and struggle is greater hope for the future, as men learn to claim and achieve for themselves the rights formerly petitioned from others.
So we part, I to my country and you to remain. We are-if a man of forty can claim that privilege-fellow members of the world's largest younger generation. Each of us have our own work to do. I know at times you must feel very alone with your problems and difficulties. But I want to say how impressed I am with what you stand for and the effort you are making; and I say this not just for myself, but for men and women everywhere. And I hope you will often take heart from the knowledge that you are joined with fellow young people in every land, they struggling with their problems and you with yours, but all joined in a common purpose; that, like the young people of my own country and of every country I have visited, you are all in many ways more closely united to the brothers of your time than to the older generations of any of these nations; and that you are determined to build a better future.
The freedom of faith, of conscience and of religious and ideological confession are inviolable.
Conscious of its responsibility before God and mankind, inspired by the will to serve the peace of the world as an equal member in a united Europe, the German people, by virtue of their constitutional power, have given themselves this Constitution.

A new report by 11,scientists in countries from a broad range of disciplines warns that the planet âclearly and unequivocally faces a climate emergency,â and provides six broad policy goals that must be met to address it.
The study, called the âWorld scientistsâ warning of a climate emergency,â marks the first time a large group of scientists has formally come out in favor of labeling climate change an âemergency,â which the study notes is caused by many human trends that are together increasing greenhouse gas emissions.
On energy, the report calls for the world to âimplement massive energy efficiency and conservation practicesâ and cut out fossil fuels in favor of renewable sources of energy, a trend it notes is not happening fast enough. It also calls for remaining fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, to remain in the ground, never to be burned to generate energy, a key goal for many climate activists.

If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer. It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen, by people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different, that their voices could be that difference. It's the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled. Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been just a collection of individuals or a collection of red states and blue states. We are, and always will be, the United States of America.
And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America â the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can. At a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach out for the ballot. Yes we can. When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs, a new sense of common purpose. Yes we can. When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved. Yes we can. She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that we shall overcome. Yes we can. A man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination.
America, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves â if our children should live to see the next century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made? This is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment.

In addition to the Common Voice dataset, weâre also building an open source speech recognition engine called Deep Speech.
Both of these projects are part of our efforts to bridge the digital speech divide.
Voice recognition technologies bring a human dimension to our devices, but developers need an enormous amount of voice data to build them.
Currently, most of that data is expensive and proprietary.
We want to make voice data freely and publicly available, and make sure the data represents the diversity of real people.
Together we can make voice recognition better for everyone.
Weâre crowdsourcing an open-source dataset of voices.
Donate your voice, validate the accuracy of other peopleâs clips, make the dataset better for everyone.
Contributors record voice clips by reading from a bank of donated sentences.
Voice clips are entered into a submission queue that readies them for listening.
Users validate the accuracy of donated clips, checking that the speaker read the sentence correctly.
Is the clip valid?
A voice clip is marked "valid" when a user gives it a Yes vote.
To make it into the Common Voice dataset, a voice clip must be validated by two separate users.
The Common Voice Dataset contains hundreds of thousands of voice samples that help developers build voice recognition tools.
When a user rejects a voice clip it returns to the Queue.
If rejected a second time, the voice clip is moved to the Clip Graveyard.
The Clip Graveyard consists of voice clips that didn't make it into the Common Voice dataset.
Just like the dataset, the Clip Graveyard is available for download.

The legend of the submerged city of Ys, or Is, is perhaps the most romantic and imaginative effort of Breton popular legend.
Who has not heard of the submerged bells of Ys, and who has not heard them ring in the echoes of his own imagination?
This picturesque legend tells us that in the early days of the Christian epoch the city of Ys, or Ker-is, was ruled by a prince called Gradlon, surnamed Meur, which in Celtic means âthe Great.â
In the early days of the Christian era, the city of Ys was ruled by a prince called Gradlon.
Gradlon was a saintly and pious man.
Gradlon was a saintly and pious man, and acted as patron to GwÃ©nnolÃ©, founder and first abbÃ© of the first monastery built in Armorica.
Gradlon was a prudent prince, and defended his capital of Ys from the invasions of the sea by constructing an immense basin to receive the overflow of the water at high tide.
This basin had a secret gate, of which the King alone possessed the key, and which he opened and closed at the necessary times.
Gradlon, as is so often the case with pious men, had a wayward child, the princess Dahut.
Gradlon, as is so often the case with pious men, had a wayward child, the princess Dahut, who on one occasion while her father was sleeping gave a secret banquet to her lover, in which the pair, excited with wine, committed folly after folly, until at last it occurred to the frivolous girl to open the sluice-gate.
Stealing noiselessly into her sleeping fatherâs chamber she detached from his girdle the key he guarded so jealously and opened the gate.
The water immediately rushed in and submerged the entire city.
But, as usual, there is more than one version of this interesting legend.
The city of Ys, says another account, was a place rich in commerce and the arts, but so given over to luxury as to arouse the ire of St GwÃ©nnolÃ©, who, in the manner of Jeremiah, foretold its ruin.
A strong dike protected the city from the ocean, the sluices only admitting sufficient water for the needs of the town.
Gradlon constantly bore round his neck a silver key which opened at the same time the vast sluices and the city gates.
Gradlon lived in great state in a palace of marble, cedar, and gold.
The king's only grief was the conduct of his daughter Dahut, who, it is said, âhad made a crown of her vices and taken for her pages the seven capital sins.â
But retribution was at hand, and the wicked city met with sudden destruction.
One night Dahut stole the silver key for the purpose of opening the city gates to admit her lover, and in the darkness by mistake opened the sluices.
But retribution was at hand, and the wicked city met with sudden destruction, for one night Dahut stole the silver key for the purpose of opening the city gates to admit her lover, and in the darkness by mistake opened the sluices.
King Gradlon was awakened by St GwÃ©nnolÃ©, who commanded him to flee, as the torrent was reaching the palace.
The king mounted his horse, and, taking his worthless daughter behind him, set off at a gallop, the incoming flood seething and boiling at his steedâs fetlocks.
The torrent was about to overtake and submerge him when a voice from behind called out: âThrow the demon thou carriest into the sea, if thou dost not desire to perish.â Dahut at that moment fell from the horseâs back into the water, and the torrent immediately stopped its course.
Gradlon reached Quimper safe and sound.
An ancient ballad on the subject, which, however, bears marks of having been tampered with, states, on the other hand, that Gradlon led his people into extravagances of every kind, and that Dahut received the key from him, the misuse of which precipitated the catastrophe.
Dahut, the ballad continues, became a mermaid and haunted the waters which roll over the site of the city where she loved and feasted.
âFisherman,â ends the ballad, âhave you seen the daughter of the sea combing her golden hair in the midday sun at the fringes of the beach?â
âYes,â replies the fisherman, âI have seen the white daughter of the sea, and I have heard her sing, and her songs were plaintive as the sound of the waves.â
The fishermen in that lake see distinctly under the water, in calm weather, ecclesiastical towers, which, according to the custom of the country, are slender and lofty, and moreover round; and they frequently point them out to strangers travelling through these parts, who wonder what could have caused such a catastrophe.
In the Welsh version of this fascinating legend it is the bard Gwyddno, of the twelfth century, who tells of the downfall of the submerged city.
Like their brothers of Ireland, the fishermen of Wales assert that at low tide they can see the ruins of ancient edifices far down beneath the clear waters of the bay.
Before the days of the French Revolution there was still to be seen at Quimper, between the two towers of the cathedral, a figure of King Gradlon mounted on his faithful courser.
She told him that she hates cooking.
Perhaps you don't know it, but nobody could replace you.
A year has already passed.
They are hiding something.
Americans have long been drawn to big, open spaces, so perhaps itâs no surprise that houses built in the United States are among the most expansive on the planet.
American houses are big. And they keep getting bigger.
The size of the average house has more than doubled since the 1950s.
I wish I knew his address.
In 2019, the average size of a new single-family home was square meters (2,square feet), according to the National Association of Homebuilders.
Deeply held feelings about oneâs home may be rooted in Americaâs homesteading, pioneering past.
âThe appeal of the house for Americans, going back into the 20th century, was that it signified autonomy. You know, every home is a castle,â says Louis Hyman, an economic historian and assistant professor at Cornell University. âSo, it has these echoes of signifying independence and achievement.â
The average newly built house is now twice as big as the average new home in 1945.
The federal government has pushed the idea that a nation of homeowners is ideal.
The establishment of the Federal Housing Administration revolutionized home ownership.
By creating the financial mortgaging system that Americans still use today, the FHA made home buying more accessible for millions of people.
At the time, most Americans rented.
Homeownership stood at 40% in 1934. By 2001, the figure had risen to 68%.
In the 1940s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt equated homeownership with citizenship, saying that a ânation of homeowners, of people who own a real share in their own land, is unconquerable.â
Today, the homeownership rate in the United States stands at around 65%.
Although unemployment is near a record low, real wages â the number of goods and services that can be bought with money earned â havenât budged in decades for U.S. workers.
As Americans find that their wages are stagnating after the 1970s, they're able to make money by investing in houses,â Hyman says.
The houses become a way for average Americans to get financial leverage, which can multiply their returns. There's no other way for Americans to get access to financial leverage outside of houses. You can't do it in the stock market if youâre just a normal person, and so this is a way to basically speculate in housing.
For many Americans, a large home is not only a status symbol, but also an investment.
Neither of my parents are alive.
For some Americans, owning a big home is a status symbol, physical proof that theyâve succeeded in life.
âThis kind of classical example of the big suburban home has been a very powerful idea for many, many decades now,â says architectural historian William Richards. âPeople sometimes want specific rooms that have specific functions âa mud room; everybody gets their own bedroom; there's no bunking up; a dedicated laundry room.â
I am going shopping. Do you need anything?
Spacious houses are more financially attainable than they used to be.
The computer is on the desk.
But do bigger houses, sometimes called McMansions, make people happier?
âDespite a major upscaling of single-family houses since 1980, house satisfaction has remained steady in American suburbs,â Bellet writes in the report.

Explaining the meaning of the parable of the richer and Lazarus, the Seventh-day Adventists claim that the rich man experienced physical pain, what could only happen after the Second Coming of Christ and the judgment of sinners. Therefore, in their opinion, the events described in this parable relate to the Second Coming, and are not proof of the immortality of the soul.
Unlike most Protestants, Seventh-day Adventists do not believe in the immortality of the soul and eternal hell fire.
Some passages from the apostolic epistles may cast doubt on the Seventh-day Adventist doctrine of the denial of the immortality of the soul.

Americaâs affluent class is bigger than ever, with more disposable income to treat itself to indulgences like massages, manicures, pedicures, and personal trainers.
While jobs for middle class Americans continue to shrink, work positions are growing at the top and the bottom of the payscale.
Laborers in the emerging underclass who cater to the whims of the better-off are sometimes referred to as âwealth workers."
Not only are there more rich people, but there are more people who are doing fairly well, and all of them are willing to pay for these services, whether it's yoga instructors or dog walking or task running. And there are more people than ever in the lower third of the distribution that really need this sort of work.
âWhat we don't have a lot of in the country is middle-wage income ... work that we might say was traditionally more solid or dignified,â Muro says.
Personal care and services occupations are the fastest growing segment of the job market for non-college-educated workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. These jobs are expected to grow 17% in the next decade, resulting in more than million new jobs.
The number of manicurists and pedicurists doubled between and 2017, according to the Brookings Institute.
The number of fitness trainers and dog walkers increased at up to three times the rate of overall employment.
Kathleen Chirico walks several dogs as part of her daily routine as a dog walker.
These workers are among the most vulnerable to exploitation by their employers, and rarely enjoy benefits like sick leave, vacation packages, pensions or retirement.
One-third of the American workforce is currently involved in the so-called gig economy, about 10% of them full time. The rest are part time, picking up gigs â such as driving for the Uber car service â to supplement income from another job.
I think itâs good for the economy because these are people who need those jobs.
The question is not how do we get rid of the gig economy, but how do we marry that with security? And it's not just a question for gig workers, but for all low-wage workers in America.
Hyman says one answer to the problem could be to set up a system of portable benefits. âEvery time there is a transaction, every time somebody comes to your door and delivers something to you, a dollar goes into their retirement account and a dollar goes into their health care fund,â Hyman says.
It is likely there will always be demand for service work, jobs that often serve to emphasize the divide between the haves and the have-nots.

A 17-year-old male in Michigan is said to be the first person in the United States to receive a bilateral lung transplant for vaping-related injuries.
"What I saw in his lungs is nothing that I've ever seen before, and I've been doing lung transplants for years," said Hassan Nemeh, M.D., surgical director of the Thoracic Organ Transplant System at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit.
Tom has a very busy schedule.
First admitted to Ascension St. John Hospital in Detroit in September, the then-16-year-old showed symptoms consistent with pneumonia.
As his condition deteriorated rapidly, however, he was transferred to Children's Hospital of Michigan after less than a week and placed on life support.
Doctors took dramatic measures to save the teen's life.
"Within a very short period of time, our lives have been forever changed. From the typical life of a perfectly healthy 16-year-old athlete â attending high school, hanging out with friends, sailing and playing video games â to waking up intubated and with two new lungs," stated the family.
The family urged people to stop vaping.
"If this press announcement saves just one person, prevents others from vaping or inspires someone addicted to seek help to quit, it is surely a step in the right direction," said the patient's family.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 2,people in the U.S. have suffered lung injuries related to vaping, and at least people have died.
Health officials have pointed to vitamin E acetate, an additive found in vaping products, as a likely culprit.
According to the CDC, however, rates of tobacco use are rising among America's youth. Last year, 4.million middle- and high school students used tobacco, an increase from 3.million in 2017.
"This increase â driven by a surge in e-cigarette use â erased past progress in reducing youth tobacco product use," stated a CDC Vital Signs report.
