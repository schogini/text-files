Marine biologist Lara Muaves witnessed the impact of climate change firsthand this year, when two devastating cyclones tore through her native Mozambique, leaving hundreds dead, including her best friend.
Across the planet, young people are leading the fight against climate change, prodding leaders and their parents to take action.
Sixteen-year-old Greta Thunberg—named Time magazine's Person of the Year—has catalyzed a once-lonely school climate strike into a worldwide weekly movement gathering tens of thousands of fellow teenagers.
Only four in Africans have ever heard the term climate change, according to a Afrobarometer survey.
Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has been named Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2019.
Thunberg is the youngest person to win the award after quickly evolving into one of the world's most prominent climate change activists.
Thunberg's straightforward speaking style captured the attention of world leaders, resulting in invitations to speak at several high-profile events, including at the United Nations and before the United States Congress.
During her appearance before U.S. lawmakers, Thunberg, who has Asperger syndrome, refused to read prepared remarks. She, instead, submitted the U.N.'s global warming report to them and declared, "I don't want you to listen to me. I want you to listen to the scientists, and I want you to unite behind the science."
One of her most memorable moments came at the U.N. Climate Change Summit in September, when she berated U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and other world leaders, declaring they had stolen her "dreams of childhood" with their "empty words."
"We are in the beginning of a mass extinction," she said, "and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!"
Those words resonated worldwide, energizing climate change activists and sparking a series of prompting scornful reactions from others.

Gabon has invested millions of dollars to fight the poachers and protect its unique wildlife.
The number of park rangers has grown from about to 850.
Despite the increased investment, the country is losing about elephants each month to poachers.
The more Gabon has resisted the poachers, the more dangerous the fight has become for the eco-guards. Officials say gunfights are a "commonplace" occurrence for rangers.
"You never know whether you will get out alive," he said.
Beginning last year, a small U.S. Army team from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, has been training Gabonese eco-guards on how to improve techniques used to capture poachers and preserve evidence. The team also taught planning skills, land navigation and how to protect human rights.
"We not only help them preserve the wildlife, at the same time, we're disrupting criminal organizations, and we're helping them develop a better future," Air Force Colonel Chris Karns, director of public affairs for U.S. Africa Command, told VOA.

A huge Christmas display is lighting up the Washington Nationals baseball stadium in the nation's capital.
Some two and a half million Christmas lights, a meter high artificial Christmas tree, and an ice skating trail have turned the Washington Nationals stadium into a glowing winter wonderland.
Artificial Christmas trees are gaining popularity. But for most people, it's just not Christmas if their house doesn't smell like a pine forest.
When Christmas comes around, people start decorating their houses with ornaments, stockings, and, of course, Christmas trees.
The trees always look much bigger inside your house than they do outside.
Tom and Mary have a cute little Christmas tree inside their home.
The prettiest shaped trees quickly get sold and the ones that didn't get picked are turned into wreaths or decorations.
Add a few ornaments, lights and a pile of intricately wrapped gifts under the tree and it means that Christmas has arrived!
A team of Mexican entrepreneurs were the winners of the Hult Prize -- a $million award presented each year to aspiring young visionaries from around the world who are creating businesses with a positive social impact.
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, who’s been a major supporter of the Hult Prize since its inception in 2009, announced the winners.
"These young people are our best hope for the future,” Clinton said. “Look at them! They are from all over the world. They are happy to be together. They think what they have in common is more important then what divides them."
Rutopia, the winner, connects tourists with indigenous communities in rural areas of Mexico.
"I was an investment banker, the child of refugees, who felt unfulfilled with their own life and my contribution to society,” he said. “So I felt young people had to choose: be good or be cold-hearted investment bankers. So I created The Hult Prize as a platform to equip them, arm them, and then deploy capital to these young people and their ideas; capital that can help them change the world."
Previous Hult Prize winners have included people like Mohammed Ashour, co-founder and CEO of the Aspire Food Group, which harvests crickets as a source of protein to feed the world.
The theme for the Hult Prize is the issue of climate change.

Merrill maintains a good relationship with her ex — as long as they don’t discuss politics, religion or gun control.
Merrill says there were other issues in her marriage.
She’d had a growing sense that she and her partner weren't compatible.
Her husband’s steady shift to the political right during their 24-year marriage was a source of frustration and embarrassment for liberal Jennifer Merrill, but it wasn’t until the election of Donald Trump — and her husband’s support for the president — that she’d finally had enough.
Merrill moved out and filed for divorce.
“I just couldn't see sharing a bed with somebody that agreed with what Trump was doing when I was so against everything that Trump represented,” says Merrill, a book editor for a trade association, and the mother of three children.
