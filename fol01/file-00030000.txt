 It was a party to celebrate her birthday.
 I think she made up that story.
 It is an index of her character.
 It's an answer to her letter.

 It is an insult to her.
 Does it bark at her?
 It has great weight with her.
 It was something she did not want to put into words.
 It was the first gold medal that she had won.
 It was a mistake on their part.
 It proved to be the deathblow to their plan.
 That shows his theoretical background.
 It is to his advantage.
 That is no business of his.
 It runs against his character.

 That's his specialty.
 That does not accord with his statement.
 Ask him about it.
 It will do him no harm.
 It has had no effect on him.
 It was a purchase which he could not possibly afford.
 It is too easy a task for him.
 It was a very good experience for him.
 It is a matter of indifference to him.

 That's asking too much.
 It is reported in the local news.
 It is cheap, but on the other hand it is not good.
 It's merely a joke.
 It was simply an oversight.
 Through whom am I to make my complaint, then?
 I think it is a mere coincidence.
 Whose idea was it?
 It's the same for everyone.
 Anyone can do it easily.
 Anybody knows it.
 That's quite a problem.
 Please have someone else do it.

 It's an artificial flower.
 It was a breath-taking close game.
 How many kilograms does it amount to?
 I think that is based on a lack of mutual understanding.

 I don't like it at all.
 That's quite absurd.
 That makes no sense at all.
 That's quite another thing.
 That's absolute nonsense!

 That's a completely unfounded rumor.
 That's an unusual thing, undoubtedly.
 That's quite to my taste.
 That's absolute nonsense.
 It is a sheer waste of time.
 That is not altogether false.

 It really hit the spot.
 That is all right.
 That made a profound impression on me.
 It isn't new.
 It's new.
 It's a delicate problem.
 That requires careful consideration.
 That every one who believes in him may have eternal life.
 That is not a proper subject to bring up in conversation at the dinner table.
 It is best left untouched.
 It is soft to the touch.
 It is merely an ornament.
 I just meant it as a joke.
 That's an excellent wine.
 It is not a matter to laugh about.

 It needs to be repaired.
 That was the end of the class.
 You are telling it second hand, aren't you?
 That's like carrying coals to Newcastle.
 That will benefit the community.
 It will make for the society.
 It is just an act.
 It is in fact your fault.
 That is an actual fact.
 It's worthwhile carrying out the idea.

 That doesn't accord with my principle.
 That is the exactly the same idea as I have.
 It's for my personal use.
 It is outside my area of study.
 It is the factory, my brother works in.
 That is in my recollections.
 It fell short of my expectation.

 It's too difficult for me.
 It was a nervous moment for me.
 It's all one to me.
 That's good news to me.
 That has nothing to do with me.

 It is not acceptable to our moral code.
 Does that mean you want to break up?
 It is like the air we breathe.
 That was the most interesting film that we had ever seen.
 It's me.
 It is not because I hate him, but because I love him.

 It happened prior to my arrival.
 I am to blame for it.
 It's not something I'm very good at.

 It has nothing to do with the subject we are discussing.
 It may occur at any moment.
 It is the in thing to do.
 That was the most exciting concert I have ever been to.
 It has become quite common.

 That is going too far.
 It simply doesn't bear thinking about.
 That's putting it mildly.
 That is most agreeable to the taste.
 This isn't fair.
 That's not a proper thing to say.
 That whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
 Won't it keep until later?
 It is like letting a tiger run loose.
 That's nothing but a figure of speech.
 You had better leave it unsaid.
 That goes without saying.
 It is saying too much.
 It is the oldest wooden building in existence.
 It was similar in some ways to soccer which is played today.

 I'm not sure about that. It depends.
 That's an old trick.
 It smells delicious.
 I can't help it.
 It's worth a try.
 I think it's worth a try.
 It would be better to try.
 Keep it at a lower temperature.
 It is written in easy English.
 It must be done more carefully.

 You should leave it for tomorrow.
 That's one level down.
 It was an event that occurred only rarely.
 It was hard as rock.
 It was like watching a slow motion movie.
 It sounds as if genius compensates for lack of experience.

 It's all up to you.
 That doesn't regard you at all.
 It happened completely by accident.
 It has nothing to do with you.
