The proper translation of the saying is 'Give your child guidance, or they will go astray.' It does not mean 'Beat the shit out of your child or he will become rotten', as many fundamentalist parents seem to believe.

As far as I understand despite my short knowledge, here in Venezuela we must adapt to the prevailing mentality and social order, therefore an individual must live among opportunism, poverty, manipulation and superficiality.

Everybody knows what's happening, but nobody raises his voice or even if somebody did, nobody would support him. Only the enlightenment through education could end the ignorance that scourges our people, from which many other problems come up. However, it's unlikely to expect that a government proposes to spread values that threaten its own interests, because it's better for them to keep society ignorant in order to manipulate them with ease.

Come home before pm.
I wish you were here.
Don't you try to hide, with those angel eyes?
There is a darkness.
I can feel it in your touch.
We are young.
