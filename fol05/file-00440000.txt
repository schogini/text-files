The wolverine spends most of its life alone, defending the borders of its territory from individuals of the same sex.
Wolverines make their lair under torn-out roots, in rock crevices and in other secluded spots.
It goes to feed at dusk.
Unlike most mustelids, who lead a settled lifestyle, wolverines constantly wander in search of prey on their individual plots of land occupying up to 1500-square kilometers.
Thanks to strong paws and long claws, wolverines can easily climb trees.
It has keen eyesight, good ears, and an acute sense of smell.
It makes sounds similar to a fox yapping.
The wolverine is omnivorous.
It often eats the remains of the prey of wolves and bears.
Wolverines catch a lot of hares, black grouse, hazel grouse, and small rodents.

If this is the case, its victims are usually young calves, or injured or sick animals.

It often ravages hunters' cabins and steals prey from traps.
There is evidence that at times large wolverines attack wolves.

Leaders establish unity of purpose and direction of the organization.
They should create and maintain the internal environment in which people can become fully involved in achieving the organization's objectives.
People at all levels are the essence of an organization and their full involvement enables their abilities to be used for the organization's benefit.
A desired result is achieved more efficiently when activities and related resources are managed as a process.
Identifying, understanding and managing interrelated processes as a system contributes to the organization's effectiveness and efficiency in achieving its objectives.
Continual improvement of the organization's overall performance should be a permanent objective of the organization.
Effective decisions are based on the analysis of data and information.
An organization and its suppliers are interdependent and a mutually beneficial relationship enhances the ability of both to create value.
