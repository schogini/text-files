You've got to face the facts.
It doesn't change the facts.
I knew my only chance was to trust my instincts.
All you had to do was buy a couple of tickets.
You know I'm not good with secrets.
It's not easy sharing your secrets.
I felt like a deer in the headlights.
Tom looks like a deer caught in headlights.
Tom waived his rights.
It's a little late for second thoughts.
Tom paused to collect his thoughts.
I know now there are no limits.
I have my limits.
You said you wanted quick results.
Tom tried to get rid of the ants.
Tom was chosen from applicants.
I came by to water Tom's plants.
Hold on to your pants.
Pull up your pants.
You're not wearing any pants.
Tom has earned the right to say whatever he wants.
I didn't want to alarm the students.
I didn't want to disturb the patients.
You have hidden talents.
This is a waste of your time and your talents.
They both gave statements.
I assume you share Tom's sentiments.
I thought we had commitments.
The only problem is there's no one here who can translate these documents.
They were loving, caring parents.
I don't believe I know your parents.
Tom dined with his parents.
I inherited it from my parents.
The rains came in torrents.
Tom opened the bottle and sniffed its contents.
Tom isn't the one calling the shots.
I call the shots.
Tom calls the shots.
I'm getting some beautiful shots.
They're all in cahoots.
I'm the richest man in these parts.
Tom seems out of sorts.
I have an obligation to look out for Tom's interests.
I just ran some tests.
I can't afford any more tests.
I don't need to run any tests.
You're frightening the guests.
We have a houseful of guests.
Tom never did have much use for scientists.
No such person exists.
We have no evidence that such a virus exists.
I don't think you have the guts.
Tom has got to be completely nuts.
Tom hasn't been responding to my texts.
Tom isn't responding to my texts.
I want to put all this behind us.
Tom didn't have the courage to face us.
Tom didn't seem exactly overjoyed to see us.
Tom is sure to come to see us.
Someone's been here before us.
Somebody got there before us.
Tom was going to expose us.
I think they're trying to intimidate us.
I don't know if Tom likes us, but he doesn't hate us.
You may leave us.
They're here to save us.
Tom is making money off us.
Tom has always managed to stay one step ahead of us.
You're way ahead of us.
It has to be one of us.
We know you're one of us.
You could've been one of us.
I knew that guy wasn't one of us.
Tom is always mooching off of us.
We can work something out that's acceptable to both of us.
If you were to leave Boston, it would be better for both of us.
They will punish all of us.
Tom is going to kill all of us.
Tom means a lot to all of us.
You had every right to make fun of us.
There will be two of us.
They're almost on top of us.
Tom isn't going to just ditch us.
You'll ride with us.
Tom is toying with us.
When we come back, we'll have Tom with us.
You don't want anything to do with us.
You were lucky to catch up with us.
Come and fight with us.
We were hoping you could tell us.
I don't think Tom would try to kill us.
They can't kill us.
Nothing like that ever happened between us.
There will be no more secrets between us.
There won't be any more secrets between us.
There should be no secrets between us.
We're going for a hike later if you want to join us.
They've turned on us.
They're gaining on us.
Tom is gaining on us.
They're closing in on us.
They're not going to give up on us.
One of them even spoke to us.
They'll come to us.
You have nothing to prove to us.
Tom is a bit of a mystery to us.
I don't quite see how that's going to help us.
Tom is doing everything he can to stop us.
They're coming after us.
Tom was kind enough to make tea for us.
It's a special time for us.
They'll come for us.
Tom made this mistake intentionally.
Tom deliberately made this mistake.
The perfume bottle has a blue cap.
Tom set up a meeting for us.
Tom has done well for us.
Tom has more than enough room for us.
They left that for us.
I hope you're going to support us.
No one's getting past us.
You're either with us or you're against us.
This isn't about Tom. This is about us.
This isn't about us.
I think they went without us.
This is what Tom was trying to show us.
Tom is able to destroy us.
I have to stay with the bus.
Tom can barely focus.
It didn't take a genius to figure it out.
It looks hideous.
Tom was amazingly courageous.
I think you're absolutely gorgeous.
I can be courteous.
Tom was dubious.
The room was fairly spacious.
I don't see anything remotely suspicious.
Tom became conscious.
Tom is lying on the floor, unconscious.
You're extremely ingenious.
You think we're serious.
They're kind of serious.
Look, I'm serious.
It's deadly serious.
You're so very serious.
That should be obvious.
It seemed fairly obvious.
Tom will be getting anxious.
Tom never used to be so obnoxious.
Tom will be so jealous.
Tom was incredulous.
Tom is delusional and dangerous.
That'd be dangerous.
Tom seems to be dangerous.
It's becoming too dangerous.
It's far too dangerous.
It's way too dangerous.
It's just way too dangerous.
It was incredibly dangerous.
It's said to be very dangerous.
I think that's more than generous.
I think that's really generous.
The climb was strenuous.
It's a little presumptuous.
There's no point in being nervous.
Outsiders make Tom nervous.
Well, I didn't want to make you nervous.
Listen, I got some bad news.
I can cope with bad news.
It's bad news.
I just received some very bad news.
That can't be the good news.
I've just received some good news.
Tell me the news.
Tom was crushed by the news.
Tom delivered the horrible news.
This is stunning news.
I've just received some delightful news.
I have marvelous news.
I've just received some great news.
Tom is boarding up the windows.
Tom is luckier than he knows.
I don't know how Tom knows.
We aren't due to arrive for three days.
I'll have it in a couple days.
All I need is three more days.
Tom wasn't too happy in those days.
You've had a real hard time the last couple of days.
You're out of vacation days.
Tom has been lying for days.
It went on for days.
Tom went on a trip for a few days.
We're only asking you to do it for a few days.
That should give us another few days.
Tom will say what he always says.
Tom fumbled in his pocket for the keys.
I realized I still had your keys.
Tom fumbled with his keys.
They sent me three turkeys.
We don't stand a chance against those guys.
I've had it up to here with you guys.
Tom wants to give an answer, but of course, he can't.
Tom started to say something, but didn't.
I'd like to say it's been fun working here, but it hasn't.
Tom was sneered at.
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Tom suddenly understood what Mary was getting at.
I'm not sure what Tom is getting at.
Tom shivered when he saw the black cat.
We could all use something to eat.
You can bring us all back something to eat.
Tom was hoping to earn enough to buy something to eat.
We've been waiting thirty minutes to eat.
We're trying to find ourselves something decent to eat.
In all the excitement, I forgot to eat.
I'm not a deadbeat.
Tom isn't about to admit defeat.
That'd be great.
I'm telling you this is going to be great.
This is working great.
Just relax, Tom, you're doing great.
I think you've been doing great.
The emotional price is too great.
That must've felt so great.
The chicken was great.
Saving lives feels great.
It feels great.
It feels pretty great.
I hope you've found a seat.
Tom smiled as he took his seat.
Tom leaped from his seat.
Tom hopped in the front seat.
Tom is in the copilot seat.
Tom hopped in the backseat.
Tom shoved Mary into the backseat.
Tom is working up a sweat.
I never would've guessed that.
Tom approved that.
I guess I deserved that.
Somebody somewhere must've said that.
I guess I just realized how stupid I would look if I did that.
You'd make her the happiest woman on earth if you did that.
You can work around that.
It can't be that.
Anyone could see that.
I'm sorry you had to see that.
I don't know how I didn't see that.
I think we can manage that.
I don't know how we're going to manage that.
I can arrange that.
I can't make a guarantee like that.
Tom, you don't have to talk to me like that.
Tom doesn't usually talk to me like that.
Well, I wouldn't put it quite like that.
Don't you start talking like that.
You know I can't answer a question like that.
I wish I could drop off to sleep like that.
It was like that.
I think Tom is like that.
I don't think it works like that.
We aren't like that.
They aren't like that.
I hadn't thought of it like that.
I never really thought of it like that.
Girls don't ordinarily like that.
I do wish Tom would stop calling me that.
I suspect you've already done that.
I bet you tell everyone that.
I can appreciate that.
I can certainly appreciate that.
It's hard to believe that there are still those who believe that.
I believe you believe that.
I don't think there's much chance of that.
Surely Tom is aware of that.
Tom knows me by sight, I'm sure of that.
You have no proof of that.
That's enough of that.
I don't know what made me think of that.
I don't like the look of that.
I'm not too certain of that.
You don't want any part of that.
I'm watching that.
I don't see Tom doing that.
I don't want to discourage you from doing that.
I think I remember doing that.
I hated myself for doing that.
I don't see anybody doing that.
I have a hard time believing that.
I'm not just saying that.
I knew you weren't OK with that.
You can't go public with that.
I'm not concerned with that.
I'm comfortable with that.
I guess you can't help me with that.
I can't compete with that.
Stop playing with that.
I can work with that.
I was cool with that.
There's only one problem with that.
I could never get away with that.
I can see how you might think that.
I can feel that.
We have plenty of time for all that.
I can prevent all that.
I wanted to make sure you told them that.
I can't believe I just promised Tom that.
Try telling Tom that.
I think you'd better tell Tom that.
I think you'd better not tell Tom that.
I really believe you mean that.
It's a little more than that.
Hey, I can't ask for more than that.
It was more than that.
Tom deserves more than that.
It's a lot more than that.
I'm hoping to make stay a little longer than that.
Tom is smarter than that.
You need to be better than that.
You know me better than that.
You deserve much better than that.
Tom knows better than that.
I raised you better than that.
I taught you better than that.
You know better than that.
I'd like to think that there's more to it than that.
You're better than that.
I can't really put a price on that.
I'll stake my reputation on that.
I insist on that.
Tom would do that.
I don't know what made me do that.
Well, in this country you're not allowed to do that.
This isn't the time or the place to do that.
I don't know what possessed me to do that.
You've had more than enough time to do that.
You really shouldn't bother to do that.
Nobody's forcing you to do that.
This is the last time I'm telling you to do that.
I couldn't let you do that.
You should totally do that.
I was so looking forward to that.
I don't think it'll come to that.
It's not going to come to that.
We're hoping it doesn't come to that.
I don't think you really want to call attention to that.
I never found the answer to that.
I'm guessing you already know the answer to that.
Tom will never consent to that.
I saw to that.
I have but one thing to say to that.
I can top that.
You can help stop that.
I'm so sad to hear that.
I needed to hear that.
You didn't need to hear that.
Tom was actually rather relieved to hear that.
Tom gave up on everything after that.
There's no getting over that.
I can answer that.
Perhaps I can answer that.
I never really cared for that.
I thought you'd already been compensated for that.
I could get you arrested for that.
This isn't the time or the place for that.
You're too late for that.
I think it's already too late for that.
I could kick myself for that.
I hated Tom for that.
You can't lock me up for that.
I don't have an answer for that.
I don't think I'm ready for that.
Everybody tells themselves that.
You can't look at that.
I don't know how you can eat that.
I can respect that.
I totally get that.
I think we can accept that.
I thought we were past that.
I must ask you to do just that.
Tom is very excited about that.
Let's see about that.
I feel horrible about that.
Don't tell me you don't know anything about that.
You'd have at ask Tom about that.
I can try to talk to Tom about that.
I know a thing or two about that.
I'm real sorry to hear about that.
We're very curious about that.
Tom is kind of freaked out about that.
Tom has been talking to Mary about that.
I'll worry about that.
You're smooth, I'll give you that.
It's not for me to tell you that.
I'm under no obligation to tell you that.
I wanted to make sure you saw that.
Tom knew that.
I wanted to make sure your family knew that.
Look, I know that.
I should know that.
You're really out of line, you know that.
I don't want to know how you know that.
You never heard me say that.
I most certainly didn't say that.
Tom knows his way around a boat.
Let's get back to the boat.
You really are a spoiled brat.
We're forever in your debt.
I can predict how Tom will react.
Tom and I made a pact.
Let's stay in close contact.
That'd be perfect.
That's actually perfect.
Tom is vital to our project.
Have a little respect.
Show a little respect.
You already have my respect.
I've failed in every respect.
I'm not a suspect.
We have an image to protect.
They were very strict.
Go with your instinct.
You need to sell more product.
Tom is just getting cold feet.
I've got cold feet.
Tom shifted his feet.
Tom has trouble thinking on his feet.
Tom scrambled to his feet.
Tom leaped to his feet.
Tom got to his feet.
I'm used to thinking on my feet.
We need to find another way to make ends meet.
It's a pleasure to finally meet.
Tom didn't look both ways before crossing the street.
Tom left the building and walked down the street.
The less I know, the more interested I get.
I don't know how much worse this'll get.
I know how overwhelming it can all get.
I only wanted to forget.
Tom says he drinks to forget.
It's a trip I won't forget.
It's dead quiet.
It's almost too quiet.
The floor is quiet.
The house seemed strangely quiet.
The house is very quiet.
I chartered a jet.
I'll take the jacket.
You might want to lose the dinner jacket.
Tom removed his jacket.
There's no way I'm going to pay for your ticket.
Tom pulled an envelope out of his pocket.
Tom searched in his pocket.
Tom paid in cash that he happened to have in his pocket.
Stock prices could skyrocket.
Tom vomited into the bucket.
Tom is sitting on a picnic blanket.
Let's see your wallet.
Tom removed a card from his wallet.
Tom sighed and pulled out his wallet.
That's how we met.
You're the most amazing person I've ever met.
Hi, I'm Tom. I don't think we've ever met.
I don't want you anywhere near the medicine cabinet.
The only way this is going to happen is in secret.
Tom knows his way around a movie set.
I know all the skeletons in your closet.
Tom isn't crying anymore, but he's still obviously still upset.
You had to know Tom might get upset.
You just don't want to get wet.
Tom said that there were others on the island, but I haven't seen anyone else yet.
Well, I wouldn't do that quite yet.
It's too early to tell yet.
I don't think they've found out about Tom yet.
We've received no explanation yet.
It hasn't come up yet.
You haven't seen all the family pictures yet.
I may do it yet.
I don't want to say goodbye just yet.
Don't tell Tom just yet.
Let's not pack our bags just yet.
I don't feel ready for that just yet.
I haven't dismissed you yet.
I'm not finished with you yet.
There's hope for you yet.
That's what I don't know yet.
Tom was in on the theft.
Tom nodded his head and left.
Tom nodded and left.
You've got one minute left.
You have one move left.
There's only one torpedo left.
I don't have many years left.
Tom is the only patient left.
That's your gift.
I'll take the first shift.
I'll take first shift.
I get your drift.
I must be getting soft.
Let's get one thing straight.
Let me get something straight.
Let me make sure I have this straight.
OK, let's see if I've got this straight.
I've been up hours straight.
I never could get that straight.
There's something we have to get straight.
Tom pushed against the door with all his weight.
Tom expected more of a fight.
Tom decided it wasn't really worth the fight.
Tom knows better than to fight.
Tom switched off the light.
Step into the light.
Tom cried out with delight.
I booked us an earlier flight.
This is the house where I lived when I was young.
This is the neighborhood where I lived when I was younger.
This is the neighborhood I lived in when I was younger.
I'm on your flight.
Tom put the traveler up for the night.
We only need shelter for the night.
I could hear you pacing all night.
I'm the one who danced with the kids all night.
Tom has been at it all night.
It's a school night.
I had an awful night.
Tom returned very late at night.
I wasn't even there that night.
Tom said he wasn't even there that night.
We loved what you said last night.
I don't remember that being there last night.
Tom has been working since late last night.
I had that dream again last night.
I understand you and Tom were together last night.
I left my watch on the counter last night.
I thought that you were coming over last night.
I told you everything I knew last night.
Tom looked pretty healthy last night.
I've arranged for a dinner tomorrow night.
There's going to be a press conference tonight.
Let's go on a date tonight.
I'm supposed to have the house to myself tonight.
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
I still think we should've told your dad where we're going tonight.
I'm waitressing tonight.
Tom sang better than usual tonight.
Tom is flying in tonight.
I don't think we have to worry about anybody showing up tonight.
I'm done for tonight.
I was wondering if I could sleep over at Tom's tonight.
I don't have the energy for this tonight.
We're having TV dinners tonight.
Tom is going to chill with us tonight.
I'm not having dinner with you tonight.
I'd love to come by tonight.
That's Tom on the right.
We need to get this one right.
Let's say for the moment that you're right.
There's nothing worse than being half right.
At least I got something right.
I just want to get this paragraph right.
That's quite all right.
Just pray I'm right.
I thought I'd know when the time was right.
I thought Tom would know when the time was right.
I only need another few days to make things right.
I'm going to make this right.
It feels right.
You have to do that just right.
For once in your life, you're exactly right.
You gave me a fright.
You gave me such a fright.
Tom was out of sight.
Tell your men to stay out of sight.
Tom came in sight.
There was no hope in sight.
Tom is nowhere in sight.
The end is in sight.
Tom will be killed on sight.
I never knew you and Tom were so tight.
I didn't plan on being caught.
I don't plan on getting caught.
Tom is clearly agitated and distraught.
My testimony can't be bought.
You're even dumber than I thought.
It's just as I thought.
I don't know what I thought.
That's a nice thought.
Tom seems to be deep in thought.
Tom was still lost in thought.
Tom is lost in thought.
OK, hold that thought.
That's an ugly thought.
Tom shut the cage and latched it.
I think you liked it.
Someone else must've opened it.
I might have mentioned it.
Tom's cell phone rang and he answered it.
Nobody could've guessed it.
You can't have wanted it.
I've accepted it.
I've already accepted it.
Tom never actually came out and said it.
I can respect why you did it.
I don't know how they're going to avoid it.
I don't think I could stand it.
Tom could hardly stand it.
I'll let you know when I find it.
Tom said I should've been able to find it.
I'm going to find it.
Take it from me, Tom, you'll never find it.
I don't know who's behind it.
We have evidence that Tom was behind it.
That's how I found it.
I want everything replaced just as we found it.
I don't know how Tom stood it.
Tom couldn't face it.
I'm so glad you made it.
Tom's name was on the list with a question mark beside it.
That's the way I see it.
Tom told me he had a right to see it.
You'll never see it.
They can't see it.
If something bad happened, I didn't see it.
I always knew you were going to make it.
I don't think I'm going to make it.
I don't think Tom is going to make it.
Hey, you're not going to make it.
You'll never make it.
I suppose Tom didn't make it.
Trust me, you'll like it.
Don't think I won't like it.
I'm sure you won't like it.
Tom didn't dislike it.
You gave me your word and you broke it.
Now you've done it.
I said ignore it.
Tom is starting to lose it.
Tom said I might lose it.
Give us a chance to investigate it.
You can take it or leave it.
You can't just have it.
I'm beginning to believe it.
I bet I can prove it.
I don't have to prove it.
I'm going to prove it.
I didn't say they deserve it.
I told them to stuff it.
Tom didn't see anything. I made sure of it.
Tom was sure of it.
I hated every minute of it.
Tom is loving every minute of it.
You don't know the half of it.
You'll get the hang of it.
Tom never thought anything of it.
Don't think of it.
I couldn't make head or tail of it.
I'm sure Tom will be able to get to the bottom of it.
There's a mystery here and I want to get to the bottom of it.
That's only part of it.
I don't want any part of it.
That's the last of it.
Make the most of it.
This isn't the worst of it.
I wouldn't make a big deal out of it.
You've taken all the fun out of it.
Leave us out of it.
I just can't get out of it.
I did my best to keep you out of it.
Tom seems really out of it.
Tom is still pretty out of it.
Tom picked up the letter and begins reading it.
Tom couldn't resist touching it.
I hated myself for thinking it.
Tom took a soda from the fridge and started drinking it.
Tom saw that Mary was losing it.
I don't know how you can keep eating it.
You're not getting it.
You don't have to watch it.
This is pretty much it.
I'll talk you through it.
I wish I had a chance to finish it.
Tom was OK with it.
Tom seems OK with it.
I don't know if I can cope with it.
I can live with it.
I'll have to live with it.
You have to live with it.
You'll learn to live with it.
I had to go along with it.
I can't find anything wrong with it.
I'm going to stick with it.
This is my problem and I'm going to deal with it.
They're having fun with it.
I'll run with it.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
I had practically nothing to do with it.
I don't know how Tom put up with it.
I'm vaguely familiar with it.
Do what you want with it.
They're getting away with it.
Tom isn't getting away with it.
Nobody crosses me and gets away with it.
I know it's going to be worth it.
Let's chuck it.
That's not why I took it.
That could explain it.
I'll stake my job on it.
You have my personal word on it.
I give you my word on it.
I'll stake my life on it.
I'm going to put my name on it.
Tell them we're working on it.
Tom looks like he's really concentrating on it.
Buy me another beer and I'll think on it.
I've already put Tom to work on it.
I thought Tom was in on it.
You might want to get in on it.
I'll stake my reputation on it.
That'd do it.
If it was easy, anybody could do it.
This should do it.
I helped other people do it.
That's how we do it.
That's when I'll do it.
I let Tom do it.
Tom isn't too old to do it.
The longer you wait, the harder it's going to be to do it.
I'm not saying we're not going to do it.
You just have to want to do it.
That's the way to do it.
You mean you couldn't do it.
Don't think I won't do it.
OK, let's just do it.
That should about do it.
You would have gotten away with it if Tom hadn't seen you do it.
Don't get too used to it.
I couldn't swear to it.
Let's get to it.
Tom beat you to it.
I saw to it.
Tell them we're looking into it.
Put your backs into it.
I really don't want to get into it.
I never plan anything if I can help it.
I don't know what we can do to stop it.
If there's something I ought to know, I'd like to hear it.
Don't expect me to lose any sleep over it.
I'm saying get over it.
They'll get over it.
I'm completely over it.
There's no need for it.
We paid for it.
We'll wait here for it.
Anyone stupid enough to go there is asking for it.
I almost fell for it.
We're going to have to make a run for it.
You've just got to go for it.
We'll pay you for it.
You were so ready for it.
I suppose that's it.
That's how Tom does it.
That nails it.
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
You were bad at it.
I was good at it.
They're still going at it.
You're going to eat it.
Let me inspect it.
It'll happen again if we don't correct it.
Tom asked for it and he's going to get it.
I think I'm starting to get it.
We should never forget it.
Tom flipped the coin in the air and then caught it.
I didn't expect you to admit it.
Everyone felt it.
Just tell me how you want it.
That's certainly not it.
I'm very much against it.
I know you're up against it.
You've lost it.
I assume you all read about it.
I'm sure you all read about it.
Tom has never talked about it.
I'm very excited about it.
Don't get too relaxed about it.
We should've been told about it.
I feel really good about it.
Tom was very nice about it.
I don't want you even thinking about it.
I never stop thinking about it.
I've got a real good feeling about it.
I look forward to hearing about it.
Let Tom go and we'll talk about it.
I'm not going to talk about it.
Let's hope they don't even think about it.
Don't you even think about it.
You don't even want to think about it.
I guess I didn't really think about it.
Someone should write a book about it.
There's not much Tom can do about it.
Tom is kind of worked up about it.
I guess that's about it.
We were very serious about it.
Don't fret about it.
Tom was a good sport about it.
I'll tell you about it.
Tom said you knew about it.
Tom doesn't have to know about it.
Tom isn't going to know about it.
I can live without it.
This was your big chance, Tom, and you blew it.
I knew you'd blow it.
I don't want to blow it.
Don't tell me you don't know it.
I'll be up and around before you know it.
I need to hear you say it.
I'm sure you won't enjoy it.
That was worth the wait.
You're welcome to wait.
It's going to have to wait.
I could hardly wait.
We should be OK here for a bit.
Just sit there for a bit.
I don't like the sound of that one bit.
I'm a creature of habit.
Tom is a creature of habit.
We're all creatures of habit.
Tom is asking for credit.
It doesn't fit.
I knew I could make it fit.
I don't care about profit.
We think Tom knows more about Mary's death than he's willing to admit.
I'm doing the speed limit.
They've upped my limit.
Tom is going to die in the morning for a crime he didn't commit.
Tom was about to get his learner's permit.
I admire your grit.
I have to say I admire your spirit.
We're more than willing to extend our visit.
It looks like you could use a new suit.
You can imagine how Tom felt.
I feel as good as I've ever felt.
You can imagine how they felt.
If Tom escapes, it'll be your fault.
The rest was my fault.
You made that difficult.
I'm practically an adult.
This is a good result.
Sometimes the most important clues are the ones that seem the most insignificant.
I didn't know what it all meant.
That's very elegant.
I thought you were brilliant.
Tom looked indignant.
We really have to be more tolerant.
Tom seemed reluctant.
Just tell them I'm a consultant.
I think birthdays are important.
Tom realized Mary might be telling him something important.
That's very distant.
I know what's relevant.
I can put it back in the drawer if you want.
You can think that if you want.
Believe anything you want.
They might have what you want.
There is a price for always getting what you want.
They might sell what you want.
I'll kiss you if that's what you want.
I can be exactly what you want.
The ruins are truly magnificent.
I'll be out of jail as soon as the police realize I'm innocent.
They must know I'm innocent.
I've improved my reaction time by almost thirty percent.
Tom met with a traffic accident.
Tom couldn't bring himself to tell Mary about the accident.
Tom's death may not have been an accident.
Tom has been missing since the incident.
That was evident.
I haven't exactly been prudent.
Tom was just a lonely exchange student.
I hope I can be a worthy student.
It wasn't sufficient.
I just had a meeting with the new client.
That's real convenient.
It's a little inconvenient.
Perhaps they thought you were a patient.
Tom was a mental patient.
Tom looked impatient.
Tom felt himself growing impatient.
They became silent.
They were silent.
The crowd fell silent.
Tom fell silent.
Your paper was excellent.
I could never be violent.
They're not all violent.
Tom was disconcerted by the announcement.
This is why I didn't want to make an announcement.
We have a signed divorce agreement.
Tom nodded his head in agreement.
Tom nodded his head to show his agreement.
I'm not trying to back out of that agreement.
They seem to be having a disagreement.
Use your best judgment.
I can live with that arrangement.
They're in their element.
Maybe I'll come out of retirement.
The police will be very interested to learn that you're keeping Tom locked up in the basement.
Tom's eyes twinkle with amusement.
Tom was puzzled by Mary's statement.
I made an error in judgment.
I've always trusted your judgment.
I've always had complete confidence in your judgment.
Tom glanced around in astonishment.
We've received our first assignment.
Tom will be out in a moment.
Tom will join you in a moment.
They chatted for a moment.
Tom felt dazed for a moment.
Tom stopped reading for a moment.
Tom thought about it for a moment.
They were silent for a moment.
I'll be out of your way in just a moment.
It was an awkward moment.
Tom is caught up in the moment.
Look, we're safe enough for the moment.
I'm seeing someone at the moment.
We have some pressing issues to deal with at the moment.
Tom isn't interested in a promotion at the moment.
Tom and Mary looked at each other for a long moment.
That was a beautiful moment.
Tom hasn't been looking forward to this moment.
Tom might be a lot safer than we are at this moment.
We have a few questions concerning Tom's medical treatment.
I neither expect nor require any special treatment.
Tom is entitled to better treatment.
It's a lifetime commitment.
It's a serious commitment.
It's a lifetime appointment.
You missed your ten o'clock appointment.
I came to get an appointment.
Tom couldn't hide his disappointment.
We have a warrant to search your apartment.
I wasn't in your apartment.
Tom was found strangled in his apartment.
Tom trudged up the stairs to his apartment.
The AC's out in my apartment.
We ended up having a big argument.
You make an interesting argument.
They seem to be having an argument.
Tom would be a formidable opponent.
Tom is a worthy opponent.
Tom is way behind on his rent.
Tom just wants to be different.
Tom's priorities are different.
I don't know why I expected anything different.
I feel different.
It's been different.
This time it's different.
That's what makes us different.
It was totally different.
It doesn't feel any different.
Tom will never consent.
Let's be content.
Tom was content.
It's a black tie event.
Tom couldn't paint.
You make a good point.
Let me get to the point.
Whether I have a problem with it isn't the point.
That's my whole point.
Everybody has a breaking point.
Tom was robbed at gunpoint.
Don't hold back on my account.
That's the exact amount.
Tom is fast asleep on the cot.
That's as far as I got.
It's no big secret that Tom stepped out on his wife every chance he got.
Tom is the only family he's got.
You gave as good as you got.
It's a little hot.
Tom was getting hot.
You think you're so hot.
You're incredibly hot.
I gave it a shot.
You'll get only one shot.
You're going to get yourself shot.
It's kind of a long shot.
I'm pretty sure I had a tetanus shot.
Take your best shot.
That was a lucky shot.
Tom is an expert with a slingshot.
Like I said, you're an idiot.
I've been an idiot.
I move around a lot.
That sounds like a lot.
Tom is keeping a low profile, so he stays home a lot.
I know it's asking a lot.
It could matter a lot.
I don't expect a lot.
Tom wasn't around a whole lot.
Tom put the car into gear and slowly pulled out of the parking lot.
Tom is sitting in his car in the parking lot.
Tom's name will stay on the ballot.
You forgot to mention whether it was successful or not.
It happens whether you plan it or not.
I can't imagine why not.
Tom and I got off on the wrong foot.
I think we got off on the wrong foot.
Tom pushed the silent alarm with his foot.
Drop your weapon or I'll shoot.
Tom began to shoot.
It looks like you missed a spot.
I was arrested on the spot.
Tom is in a tough spot.
It's hard to accept.
I know it's hard to accept.
Tom has no choice but to accept.
Tom was snoring loudly while he slept.
I'm not usually this inept.
You said I wasn't to interrupt.
I don't think you have the heart.
I'm nursing a broken heart.
Tom is a man after my own heart.
Just tell Tom what's in your heart.
Just say what's in your heart.
You have to follow your heart.
I've always been a romantic at heart.
I think that's really smart.
I think you're plenty smart.
That's my favorite part.
That's the tough part.
You already did your part.
That's the hardest part.
That's the worst part.
That was the worst part.
That's the scary part.
I'm not falling apart.
Only an expert can tell them apart.
We're worlds apart.
Tom woke with a start.
That would've been a good start.
I need a place to start.
That might be a good place to start.
That's a good place to start.
It's a great place to start.
It's a perfect place for us to start.
This was a stupid idea from the very start.
Tom was able to get us all tickets to tonight's concert.
Go to yellow alert.
I don't have a favorite shirt.
Tom is wearing sunglasses and no shirt.
That's a real comfort.
I can make this very short.
We've confirmed the report.
Tom has some very encouraging news to report.
I only need another few hours to finish this report.
I filed a missing persons report.
I can neither confirm or deny that report.
Tom never paid my mother any child support.
I told Tom he'd have our full support.
Tom leaned on Mary's shoulder for support.
Tom took out his passport.
It more than hurt.
A little practice couldn't hurt.
I suppose a little practice couldn't hurt.
It's not like anybody got hurt.
We have to move fast.
I had to do something fast.
Tom began to talk fast.
Keep your eyes open, it's going to happen fast.
This is all happening a little too fast.
I can only work so fast.
Thanks for doing this so fast.
I wanted to get up early to make them breakfast.
I invited them to breakfast.
There's no telling how long they'll last.
That can't last.
You should make a toast.
Gentlemen, I'd like to propose a toast.
I don't want to dredge up the past.
Tom is still the best.
It's what Tom and I do best.
Tom was one of our best.
We'll proceed exactly as you suggest.
We'll do exactly as you suggest.
I know it's a lot to digest.
Get it off your chest.

I've got to get this off my chest.

Tom needs to be checked by a specialist.
Tom's eyes were moist.
Tom is determined to resist.
It's hard to resist.
I can see why that's hard to resist.
I always thought you should've been an artist.
I'm betting it doesn't even exist.
I have to know what we're up against.
Tom tried to find out what he was up against.
They were lost.
I know when I've lost.
Tom seems to be completely lost.
Tom is as dumb as a post.
Get back to your post.
You were asleep at your post.
It's a shame you didn't talk to me first.
I'd have to take a look at it first.
You must gain Tom's trust first.
I knew I'd have to see you first.
I should've checked with you first.
I wanted to show you first.
You're the worst.

I'm not moving out.
You'd just better watch out.

The helicopter landed and Tom got out.
Tom was checking you out.
Don't let Tom catch you on the way out.
Let me show you the way out.
I can't imagine what Tom is so worried about.
I know this isn't what we talked about.
You're the one they were telling me about.
That's what I'm here about.
I know exactly the one you're talking about.
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
Tom, this is exactly what we were talking about.
That's the last thing Tom is thinking about.
This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about.
I don't think it's anything to laugh about.
It's all Tom can talk about.
You gave us something to talk about.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a lot to think about.
I've completely forgotten what it's about.
I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
I don't know what all the fuss is about.
We have enough to worry about.
I don't have anything to feel guilty about.
I think we'll stay put.
We were told to stay put.
Tom thinks we're in some kind of rut.
I could be next.
Everyone knows what'll happen next.
Tell the jury what you saw next.
I've offended you.
I'll let you know when I need you.
That's why I need you.
That's why we need you.
I can't believe I just hugged you.
I really liked you.
You know, I think that Tom really liked you.
Look, Tom, I'm sorry I bothered you.
That's why I hired you.
That's why I rescued you.
That's why I loved you.
From everything you've told me, Tom loved you.
That's why I followed you.
I knew I recognized you.
Tom would kill me if he knew I told you.
I came to find you.
I did what I had to do to find you.
We're a hundred percent behind you.
I bear no malice toward you.
We have no wish to inconvenience you.
Maybe this will convince you.
You said it was important that I see you.
I want you to see yourself the way I see you.
Boy am I glad to see you.
I needed to see you.
That's why I came to see you.
Tom, there's a policeman here to see you.
It's wonderful to see you.
I highly doubt Tom wants to see you.
I have an offer to make you.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
I could've been like you.
I need men like you.
There aren't many men like you.
I used to be married to a woman who looked a lot like you.
That's so unlike you.
I knew the truth would scare you.
I wouldn't say that around Tom if I were you.
Tom said they tried to hire you.
I'm not trying to pressure you.
I want to please you.
This may surprise you.
We can accommodate you.
I just came here to congratulate you.
I couldn't just drive off and leave you.
I won't let her have you.
They sent me to save you.
Let's assume for the moment that I believe you.
I choose to believe you.
In time, I'm sure Tom will forgive you.
Buy me a cup of coffee and I might forgive you.
I can drive you.
I could look into it if you want me to.
Tom was ashamed of you.
You will do what is required of you.
I'm sure your father would be very proud of you.
That was really nice of you.
I have a serious request to make of you.
That's really noble of you.
I'm one of you.
I love each and every one of you.
Tom took good care of you.
I could take very good care of you.

That's very mature of you.
I don't know what made me think of you.
That's very civil of you.
Tom is going to kill all of you.
We weren't making fun of you.
I don't believe the two of you.
I'm glad I ran into the two of you.
Tom said he hadn't seen either of you.
That's very elitist of you.
That's enough out of you.
I'm going to get the truth out of you.
I have no memory of you.
Nobody's forcing you.
Thank you for being you.
I don't like Tom touching you.
That's a question I should be asking you.
That's why I'm asking you.
You can do this, I'm telling you.
This is the last time I'm telling you.
Tom has been misinforming you.
I have so much to teach you.
I won't even touch you.
I've come to make my peace with you.
I'm learning Turkmen.
I can't believe I've wasted my time with you.
I could never compete with you.
I told myself I was in love with you.
We sympathize with you.
Tom was so flirting with you.
Tom was toying with you.
Tom is toying with you.
I can't find anything wrong with you.
That's what's wrong with you.
I won't go back with you.
I'm going to get right back with you.
There's only one problem with you.
I'm choosing to go with you.
I can mop the floor with you.
I'm not going to play guessing games with you.
We had intended not to meet with you.
I'm going to be straight with you.
The manager will be right with you.
I have to be honest with you.
I haven't been honest with you.
I'm going to be very honest with you.
Tell us what's new with you.
I suppose I should thank you.
That's what I'm here to ask you.
I'm not ashamed to tell you.
This is why I was afraid to tell you.
Boy have I got something to tell you.
I have so much to tell you.
It would be better for them to tell you.
I had to wait to tell you.
These are the things I couldn't tell you.
It'd kill you.
I could kill you.
Give me that or I'll kill you.
If you don't tell us, we'll kill you.
Tom is prepared to kill you.
Tom won't hesitate to kill you.
I need a good reason not to kill you.
Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.
It'd be a lot more convincing if it came from you.
I don't need a sermon from you.
I need one last favor from you.
I'm not the one who kept secrets from you.
I'm telling you this because I don't want to have any secrets from you.
I want much more than that from you.
Sorry for keeping it secret from you.
That's what I want from you.
I couldn't take money from you.
I don't wish to harm you.
I didn't intend to alarm you.
I don't want to alarm you.
I didn't mean to demean you.
Tom has a better work ethic than you.
I'm happier than you.
I can hold my liquor better than you.
I want to assure you that we've not forgotten you.
I have total confidence in you.
I didn't think you had it in you.
Let me entertain you.
The drinks are on you.
I'm not here to put pressure on you.
I checked up on you.
Please don't make me waste a bullet on you.
I used to dream about being married to you.
Tom was nothing compared to you.
I wanted to be a good friend to you.
I know this must seem incredible to you.
Tom really was horrible to you.
That's why I came to you.
I'd like to go home if it's all the same to you.
I know how important your problems are to you.
See if this makes sense to you.
I'm feeling really close to you.
I've never done anything to you.
Tom wasn't going to do anything to you.
Hey, lady, we're talking to you.
Tom, don't walk away when I'm talking to you.
Tell me why I'm talking to you.
I certainly don't mind Tom talking to you.
I guess that wouldn't mean much to you.
It'll come back to you.
Let me get back to you.
I'm going to get right back to you.
That's why I came to talk to you.
I can make the time to talk to you.
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
I'm very drawn to you.
I guess that'll be up to you.
I'll make this up to you.
I promise I'll make it up to you.
I'll do anything to make it up to you.
This will never happen again, I swear to you.
I guess this still belongs to you.
I know how this looks to you.
I want you to think about what really matters to you.
I just showed it to you.
Give me a chance to prove it to you.
I'll have it sent to you.
Maybe I'll run into you.
I was totally into you.
It's going to help you.
That isn't going to help you.
I don't know why I bother trying to help you.
I've instructed Tom to help you.
I must help you.
I think everybody's only pretending they don't hear you.
Let me tell you what I can offer you.
I don't wish to anger you.
It's not every day you get a building named after you.
They even named their boy after you.
I had a meal prepared for you.
I got it started for you.
That can't be good for you.
I guess that's good for you.
That shouldn't be hard for you.
There was a place for you.
That's gratitude for you.
Let me make this simple for you.
That's why I came for you.
Come by later, I have something for you.
Perhaps we'll ask Tom to suggest something for you.
Tom sacrificed everything for you.
If anything happens to Tom, I'll come looking for you.
There's a guy downstairs asking for you.
I'll have lunch waiting for you.
They'll be rooting for you.
Now, you let me know if this gets to be too much for you.
That should be enough for you.
I can make a phone call for you.
Tom, there's a telephone call for you.
That's why I fell for you.
I'm the only one who can get them for you.
Just think what it could do for you.
I'll have Tom bring up some dinner for you.
That'd be a good color for you.
I've got real feelings for you.
I grabbed this for you.
I can look into this for you.
I've been waiting in my quarters for you.
That's why I sent for you.
They're just for you.
Tom is just looking out for you.
I'm sure something will work out for you.
I don't think I have to spell it out for you.
I had dinner ready for you.
I'll make this easy for you.
I could tutor you.
You're not fooling anyone, Tom. We know it's you.
We all can't be as strong as you.
I don't know if you know this, but I'm not as smart as you.
I could see it was you.
I'm sorry if my being here embarrasses you.
I know the cure for what ails you.
I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
I don't know how to address you.
You're not prepared for what awaits you.
I'm sorry if I snapped at you.
I'm surprised at you.
You said you needed someone to protect you.
It's a real pleasure to meet you.
It's a real honor to meet you.
It's a great honor to meet you.
It's so good to finally meet you.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
They're out to get you.
Sometimes I don't get you.
I've upset you.
I never should've left you.
Hey, Tom, glad I caught you.
That's why Tom hit you.
You'll never know what hit you.
I got you all right where I want you.
That's why we want you.
I guess I didn't want to disappoint you.
I never would've shot you.
I almost shot you.
Come any closer, and I'll shoot you.
I figured it was better not to interrupt you.
Look, Tom, I'm sorry I hurt you.
I don't want to do anything that would hurt you.
We aren't here to hurt you.
I have no desire to hurt you.
It can't hurt you.
Don't think I won't hurt you.
I'm not going to hold that against you.
I don't hold that against you.
I won't hold it against you.
It'll cost you.
It's going to cost you.
That's why I trust you.
If you don't trust them, they won't trust you.
I was never worried about you.
I should've listened to Tom when he warned me about you.
I never stop thinking about you.
I'm starting to get a bad feeling about you.
I'm not writing about you.
I've read all about you.
Not everything is about you.
Tom, this isn't about you.
I feel the same way about you.
Tom feels the same way about you.
That's why I worry about you.
I couldn't have solved this case without you.
We're better off without you.
I figured it was better not to go without you.
I can do this with you or without you.
I don't know if I can make it without you.
I wanted you the moment I saw you.
I knew I wanted you the moment I saw you.
Hey, Tom, you've gotten a lot taller since I last saw you.
I have so much to show you.
They just want to get to know you.
I don't need to be lectured by you.
I'm still intimidated by you.
We aren't here to destroy you.
I have to say I envy you.
You nearly broke my jaw.
It's against the law.
That's not what I saw.
Tom was surprised by something he saw.
Tom liked what he saw.
Tom seems to have a different point to view.
I told you everything I knew.
My condolences to you and your crew.
Tom bowed and withdrew.
Tom propped himself up on his elbow.
You and I both know you were the one who broke the window.
Tom crossed to the window.
Tom went and shut the window.
I'm going to find out who broke this window.
I'll make myself useful somehow.
You're missing the late show.
You should have your own talk show.
You were a no show.
Tom's irritation is starting to show.
I'm surprised Tom didn't show.
It's our only show.
Please tell me you're not buying this dog and pony show.
Keep your head low.
Tom is an eccentric fellow.
It's excruciatingly slow.
Leave this area now.
We're as good as dead now.
Tom is confined to bed now.
That's all changed now.
It's finished now.
Tom is dead and buried now.
You can get dressed now.
I need to get started now.
We're not ready to have a kid now.
I want you focus on the here and now.
You can't change your mind now.
I'm done fooling around now.
If you're ever going to help us with this, it has to be now.
It's got to be now.
Tom is at peace now.
We're on the same page now.
We're totally different people now.
You'll come with me now.
We have a bit of time now.
My computer works fine now.
I want guards posted here and I want them here now.
I get the picture now.
You're part of the gang now.
The air conditioner seems to be working now.
It seems to be working now.
They're bringing him in for questioning now.
I think everybody should stand back now.
I'm in the mood to talk now.
That's how I feel now.
I don't need to see Tom now.
We have to spend time with Tom now.
That doesn't mean you should tell Tom now.
You should get your money from Tom now.
I'm going to make my own decisions from now.
I'm going to advise you to just listen now.
I'm seeking a solution even now.
I need your full attention now.
Tom has got my full attention now.
You have to leave Boston now.
Tom isn't about to back down now.
Unless you have any more questions, I'd like to go now.
I'm going to hang up now.
We're all in this together now.
I'm hanging in there for now.
We'll go with that for now.
Tom seems to understand where he stands now.
I've failed Tom so many times now.
I need to end this now.
I insist that we do this now.
Let's do this now.
It would be prudent to worry about the details now.
I'd like to get Tom behind bars now.
I don't see that it matters now.
Tom has been in there for almost three hours now.
The machine's yours now.
I'm opening my presents now.
Tom is calling the shots now.
I can see that now.
I really don't recommend doing that now.
I'm not saying I want to do that now.
It's a bit late for that now.
Tom is just trying to get your goat now.
I think this is beside the point, right now.
We're in a dangerous area right now.
I can't be bothered right now.
I'm not saying you have to explain it all to me right now.
I've been where you are right now.
I just don't care right now.
I'm coming up there right now.
I'm on my way to the meeting right now.
We have a few pressing issues to deal right now.
You don't want to be in Boston right now.
I've never needed a friend more than I do right now.
I'm in no mood to argue politics right now.
I don't feel like sorting clothes right now.
I'm not sure if I'm ready to talk about this right now.
I can't be distracted by this right now.
Tom is the least of my problems right now.
We're actually researching that right now.
I really can't comment on that right now.
I'm in no mood to do that right now.
I need to see a copy of it right now.
I don't think I could explain it right now.
That's what Tom's trying to figure out right now.
This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about right now.
That's all I know right now.
Tom is meeting with Mary right now.
Tom is going into surgery right now.
Tom is alright now.
We're in for it now.
We're serious about it now.
I'm practically an adult now.
It's so different now.
Nobody can keep us apart now.
I'm practically an expert now.
I'm very unhappy just now.
I think we've got it worked out now.
I think we've got it figured out now.
It's all behind you now.
No one's going to save you now.
I'm afraid even your friends can't save you now.
I don't think there's any harm in telling you now.
I could kill you now.
I'm coming to you now.
I think that's up to you now.
If you have a problem with any of this, I need to know now.
I meant to have that done by now.
According to his schedule, Tom should've been here by now.
I thought that was obvious by now.
You must realize that by now.
Tom knows better than that by now.
Tom should've been in contact by now.
Tom is a little creepy now.
Tom is one of the most decent men I know.
I don't know what I know.
I don't know how I know.
There's something I feel you should know.
We'll soon learn all we need to know.
I already know what I wanted to know.
I was ready to tell Tom anything he wanted to know.
You'd be the one to know.
It's not like Tom is going to know.
They know things these people want to know.
Now tell us what we want to know.
Trust me, you don't want to know.
I can ask Tom if you really want to know.
That's why I wanted you to know.
I guess we'll never know.
Tell me something interesting about Tom that I don't know.
I could get you fired, you know.
You don't fool me, you know.
We've got a situation here, you know.
Tom is out of control, you know.
I could really make things hard for you, you know.
I could really mess things up for you, you know.
You're wiser than you know.
Well, tell me what you know.
Let's go over what we already know.
I don't rightly know.
The path was narrow.
Tom said he'll pick you up from practice tomorrow.
Tom is sure to come tomorrow.
We won't get to you until tomorrow.
Tom is having his operation tomorrow.
We'll begin rehearsals tomorrow.
I'll be on my feet tomorrow.
I'm going to use it tomorrow.
I'll have it here for you tomorrow.
You should be out of here by tomorrow.
We're in the same fix.
I could swear there's something inside this box.
You haven't aged a day.
Tom smokes three packs a day.
Somebody's having a good day.
I'm having kind of a weird day.
I've had a really weird day.
Tom is packing up for the day.
It was bound to happen some day.
Tom felt deep inside that Mary was still alive, and he didn't give up hope to find and rescue her.
We'll get out of here one day.
Tom might want this back one day.
I've broken enough rules for one day.
We were destined to meet one day.
Tom had a real rough day.
It's your special day.
Today's your special day.
This is your special day.
I've been feeling this way all day.
You looked terrible the other day.
Tom put me on report the other day.
It's a gorgeous day.
It's a great day.
I'm kind of looking forward to a quiet day.
We had a slow day.
It's been a slow day.
Today must be your lucky day.
It's your lucky day.
Today's your lucky day.
Well, Tom, today is your lucky day.
Now, there's something you don't see every day.
We gain more knowledge every day.
I change my underwear every day.
Tom's heart's getting stronger every day.
We learn something new about ourselves every day.
We had a very busy day.
You'll thank me for this someday.
Tom wanted to skydive on his 30th birthday.
Tom couldn't seem to find anything suitable to give Mary for her birthday.
I have something very special planned for your birthday.
There's no way I'm going to work on Sunday.
Wait'll you hear what happened today.
Tom's trial started today.
You can't be around today.
You're in quite a mood today.
Hey, you're in a good mood today.
You're in a strange mood today.
You seem to be in such a nasty mood today.
Tom is acting very strange today.
Tom is going to die today.
I don't have any money on me today.
I'm having a very difficult time today.
I know you're not yourself today.
You've taken a big step today.
I heard you really screwed up today.
We're expecting lousy weather today.
That's plenty for today.
I know I've said some pretty stupid things today.
Tom made the company what it is today.
We have a new student joining our class today.
Tom is in high spirits today.
I really don't recommend that today.
I meant to cancel your appointment today.
I feel different today.
I feel funny today.
The most amazing thing happened yesterday.
I'm quite certain Tom was here yesterday.
Tom was in perfect health yesterday.
Tom showed me his garden yesterday.
You were such a big help yesterday.
We'll make our announcement on Thursday.
I'm going to hit the hay.
The organ started to play.
We have the whole summer to play.
This is child's play.
We offered Tom a month's severance pay.
There's a small price to pay.
That's an awfully high price to ask someone to pay.
That's the price you pay.
Maybe we should pray.
Tom began to pray.
It's just pepper spray.
You'll do exactly as I say.
That's what you should say.
Tom said you have the final say.
There's nothing more Tom can say.
Tom hasn't said anything he wasn't supposed to say.
I'll say what I have to say.
Tom was trying to think of the right thing to say.
Tom never listens to what I'm trying to say.
That's what I'm trying to say.
I have so much to say.
My real dad wouldn't tell me what to say.
That's kind of you to say.
That's nice of you to say.
That's easy enough for you to say.
That isn't for you to say.
Tom said that you said something I know you would never say.
I don't care what the regulations say.
That's exactly the kind of thing I don't want to hear you say.
It's as you say.
You know what they say.
It would mean a great deal to me if you would stay.
That doesn't mean I can stay.
We'll get you a place to stay.
It means a lot to me to know that you want me to stay.
Tom didn't care to stay.
Let's just say I'm here to stay.
I can't possibly stay.
I'll be with you every step of the way.
Something tells me we're in the way.
It's on the way.
I've been feeling the same way.
You'd feel the same way.
We go back a long way.
You and Tom go back a long way.
I pay my own way.
I don't mind either way.
We've gone miles out of our way.
Tell me you're on your way.
That's the problem with doing things your way.
Tom was in Mary's way.
They're headed this way.
I'm sorry it had to be done this way.
Thanks for coming all this way.
I truly didn't know you felt this way.
I think they went this way.
It's on its way.
Pizza is on its way.
I don't know why I reacted that way.
Tom didn't deserve to die that way.
You can't talk to me that way.
You don't talk to me that way.
You'll never escape that way.
It doesn't look that way.
Hey, it doesn't work that way.
I told Tom that he was a fool to let Mary talk to him that way.
You've always been that way.
I don't think about you in that way.
It certainly looks that way.
I don't think it works that way.
I can't have you talking to the customers that way.
You can't talk to us that way.
I'm sure Tom didn't see it that way.
Please don't think of it that way.
I hadn't thought of it that way.
You can't get out that way.
I prefer that it stay that way.
Tom is kind of crazy that way.
I finally feel like everything's going my way.
I'm expected to overcome all obstacles in my way.
I'm glad they see it my way.
I had some cash stashed away.
I have some cash stashed away.
The laughter died away.
Tom hurried away.
Tom blushed and turned away.
They'll take me away.
You'll give me away.
I couldn't bring myself to throw your picture away.
The bank is trying to take Tom's house away.
You'll give yourself away.
You've already given yourself away.
You never want to give anything away.
Tom doesn't want to give anything away.
We don't want to give too much away.
You take my breath away.
Just let me walk away.
I know it's hard to walk away.
Tom said I should just walk away.
I'm going to scare Tom away.
Tom was shot trying to run away.
It'll go away.
I just want my past to go away.
I can make this go away.
Tom wouldn't go away.
I said step away.
You seem a million miles away.
Tom's laughing could be heard three blocks away.
You both need to get away.
I just wanted to get away.
Tom had trouble sleeping when you went away.
You should be put away.
This will blow you away.
Tom helped me to clear snow away.
Tom just can't stay away.
Tom was trying to give his money away.
Tom made a clean getaway.
Get on the freeway.
They met each other halfway.
Tom didn't belong here anyway.
They'd find a way to do whatever they want to do anyway.
Tom didn't pay me enough for that anyway.
Tom, I know this is an unfair question, but I'm going to ask it anyway.
Nice of you to drop by.
You just worry about taking care of your baby.
Seriously, Tom, you need a hobby.
I got to be pretty good at rugby.
Tom is afraid of intimacy.
Tom is a stickler for accuracy.
I've arranged for a bit of privacy.
Don't make me change that policy.
Tom has had a medical emergency.
You said there was an emergency.
Tom had a family emergency.
I'm at your mercy.
I can look at it when you're ready.
I have to get Tom's lunch ready.
Nothing has to happen until you're ready.
You're just in time. Tom is almost ready.
I can feel my pulse quickening already.
Come in already.
You have my attention already.
I'm practically an adult already.
Tom was saddened by the tragedy.
It'll come in handy.
I figured this might come in handy.
Keep your gun handy.
Tom doesn't have a mean bone in his body.
I'd like to do an autopsy on this body.
You could've killed somebody.
Tom has got nobody.
I never murdered anybody.
I've never actually tortured anybody.
It could be anybody.
Tom realized he wasn't convincing anybody.
It's all right, I won't tell anybody.
I know that better than anybody.
I didn't mean to usurp anybody.
That can't be good for anybody.
Tom didn't visit anybody.
Get up, everybody.
I think I've found enough for everybody.
They've taken Tom into protective custody.
We're going to try to get you full custody.
I'm releasing Tom into your custody.
I've been watching you study.
Let me get you the key.
Tom let himself in with his own key.
Tom let himself into the house with his key.
Tom began to carve the turkey.
I hope you bought us a big enough turkey.
Tom said this is up your alley.
I could sure use that reward money.
We're doing this for the money.
We're not doing this for the money.
We can make some money.
Tom made a bunch of money.
Tom says you won a whole bunch of money.
Green is the color of money.
Tom made his company lots of money.
I really don't have a lot of money.
I know it's a lot of money.
I never needed that much money.
I assure you this is about much more than money.
I want to see if I can find out where Tom hid the stolen money.
I could sure use that scholarship money.
I'm not asking for money.
We're not really asking for money.
Tom is always hitting me up for money.
You're not laying one finger on Tom's money.
You wanted to get your hands on Tom's money.
We make great money.
I could sure use that money.
Not everything's about money.
Not everything is about money.
I assure you this isn't just about money.
You gave me quite a run for my money.
You never have any money.
Tom is an excellent attorney.
I hope they have a pleasant journey.
I really appreciate your willingness to testify.
Tom is still pretty groggy.
This is no time to quibble over terminology.
It'll help you save energy.
They were wealthy.
Tom doesn't seem particularly trustworthy.
I want to know how this happened and why.
That still leaves us with the question of why.
We never learned what happened or why.
You said you figured out why.
I'll tell you why.
I couldn't tell you why.
Next time, you won't be so lucky.
I never thought I'd get that lucky.
I couldn't get that lucky.
Tom smiled affably.
Tom smiled amiably.
Tom cried uncontrollably.
Tom smiled and laughed uncomfortably.
Tom smiled uncomfortably.
Tom fidgeted uncomfortably.
Tom is looking weak and wobbly.

Tom smiled halfheartedly.
Tom sighed profoundly.
Tom smiled awkwardly.
Tom smiled inwardly.
Tom applauded loudly.
I think this will do nicely.
I just want to get Tom home safely.
It seemed likely.
That would seem likely.
It seems likely.
I'm not saying that we can't win. I'm just saying it's not likely.
Tom looked at them closely.
Tom looked at Mary closely.
I want my money returned immediately.
I don't know why you didn't tell me immediately.
We'll get you back home immediately.
I insist that we leave immediately.
It's you who've acted inappropriately.
Tom is just a little stressed lately.
Tom has been a little unapproachable lately.
Tom has been awfully distant lately.
I'm hearing that a lot lately.
Tom took Mary into his arms, and they kissed each other passionately.

It's getting ugly.
It's going to get ugly.
This might get ugly.
It might get ugly.
This just got ugly.
You said you wanted a family.
Tom is an old acquaintance of the family.
Tom has something for the entire family.
I just thought that you might want to go home and be with your family.
You belong at home with your family.
Think about your family.
Tom is a disgrace to his family.
Tom is supported by his family.
I'm still part of this family.
I have to be there for my family.
I let my guard down momentarily.
Tom clenched his fists angrily.
Tom looked at Mary uneasily.

It's not something I can decide quickly.

I can get us there more quickly.
Tom needs to think of a solution quickly.
Tom got up quickly.
Tom closed his eyes quickly.
Tom looked at Mary quickly.
I need to get something done very quickly.
Tom stared at Mary blankly.
Tom was laughing hysterically.
Tom smiled skeptically.
Tom was put to death finally.
Don't take it so personally.
Don't take this personally.
It feels silly.
I suppose it was a bit silly.
The sail won't open fully.
Tom looks as if he's sleeping peacefully.
Tom slept peacefully.
I could've warned Tom more forcefully.
Tom smiled hopefully.
Tom prepared his speech very carefully.
Tom smiled gratefully.
Tom performed his duties faithfully.
Tom smiled thoughtfully.
The two brothers embraced warmly.
Tom smiled warmly.
Tom shut the door gently but firmly.
The door opened suddenly.
Tom woke up quite suddenly.
Tom could see it plainly.
Tom sighed deeply.
Tom didn't attempt to reply.
Tom looked at Mary sharply.
I hope you don't mind if I leave early.
I came in early.
Tom discreetly left the party early.
Tom smiled eagerly.
I haven't had time to thank you properly.
Tom cried bitterly.
Tom smiled helplessly.
Tom slept restlessly.
You'll enjoy it tremendously.
We've got to talk seriously.
Tom seemed to take the matter seriously.
Tom watched curiously.
Tom glanced at Mary curiously.
Tom looked at Mary curiously.
We waited anxiously.
You do like living dangerously.
Tom looked at Mary contemptuously.

That's my point exactly.

Tom coughed violently.
I think Tom feels differently.
Tom looked at Mary intently.
Tom smiled faintly.
Our guests will be leaving shortly.
We'll be making an announcement shortly.
It should be ready shortly.
Tom nodded curtly.
You look positively ghastly.
The door closed slowly.
Tom sipped his wine slowly.
Know your enemy.
Tom was drafted into the army.
That's as good a place as any.
This is as good place to die as any.
That's as good a way to die as any.
I suppose this is as good a time as any.
That's as good an explanation as any.
That's as good a reason as any.
There are so many.
I don't think I'd be very good company.
I suppose I could use the company.
Tom is the majority shareholder in the company.
Tom is joining our company.
You control your destiny.
It was worth every penny.
Normally this would be funny.
This is no time to be funny.

I understand why Tom would want to phone Mary.

They grew angry.
Tom will never have to worry about going hungry.
Tom felt himself getting hungry.
Tom was suddenly very hungry.
That's quite a theory.
I hope you'll find this office satisfactory.
I thought Tom's performance was satisfactory.
It's a very small price for such an important victory.
This is dangerous territory.
Hey, it's just a story.
Tom patiently waited for Mary to finish her story.
They want to tell you their story.
I'm not buying your story.
Tom told us his story.
That's a different story.
I told Tom my story.
Tom isn't being entirely truthful about his job history.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry.
Tom will be so sorry.
I'm not buying you another drink until you say sorry.
If I've misjudged you, I'm terribly sorry.
I just didn't want you to worry.
There wasn't any special hurry.
If you're going to do this, you'd better hurry.
You better hurry.
Someday you should give it a try.
We can make it if we try.
That's good for a first try.
My picture's in every police station in the country.
Tom seems to have left the country.
I'm considered a traitor to this country.
You're making this too easy.
Life could be so easy.
Thank you for making it so easy.
You're not making this easy.
Tom isn't getting off that easy.
I felt very uneasy.
It's a bit flimsy.
People are getting antsy.
I should've guessed you'd be busy.
People like you are never busy.
Like I said, I was busy.
I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
This is for your own safety.
We're concerned for your safety.
There's no reason for you to fear for your safety.
I was worried for Tom's safety.
You're personally responsible for Tom's safety.
Everyone is getting fidgety.
Tom is a danger to society.
You're a big softy.
We're safer here than we would be in a city.
I heard Tom hates publicity.
You don't have to worry about publicity.
Tom does have one redeeming quality.
It's a huge responsibility.
I've never been able to handle responsibility.
Tom hadn't considered that possibility.
I'm sensing a lot of hostility.
Have a little dignity.
Tom has immunity.
Tom was a native of Boston with deep roots in the community.
It's a remarkable opportunity.
You had plenty of opportunity.
I'm giving you an opportunity.
I know it's a great opportunity.
Tom thinks I'm missing this great opportunity.
You may have that opportunity.
I regret losing that opportunity.
I have a problem dealing with authority.
I didn't mean to challenge your authority.
Tom is a psychology major at a major university.
I admire their ingenuity.
Tom is supposed to be guilty.
I think someone stole all these things and planted them to make me look guilty.
I don't feel that guilty.
We find the defendant not guilty.
I'll see you in twenty.
I couldn't live with that kind of uncertainty.
The roads were empty.
Tom's cup was empty.
The street was very empty.
I'm not in the mood to go to a party.
Now we've got ourselves a party.
I'm at an office party.
I'll throw you a stag party.
I'll throw you a bachelor party.
You'll never make it to Tom's party.
Tom drove all the way from Boston just for my birthday party.
We have a warrant to search your property.
It makes me feel dirty.
That's a funny thing about people like you, you don't want to get your hands dirty.
You say you don't want to get your hands dirty.
Tom is still on the right side of thirty.
This is no time for modesty.
What's happened here is a travesty.
I'm so thirsty.
Tom can be a little chatty.
Did I tell you I think you're pretty?
You're so pretty.
I'm reporting for duty.
Tom reminded us of our duty.
I'm going to ask you to do your duty.
Tom only likes women under thirty or over sixty.
If you hurry, there still might be some choice items left for you to buy.
I can tell you're a nice guy.
You said your boss was a nice guy.
Tom sounds like a white guy.
You've got the wrong guy.
Tom seemed like a good enough guy.
Tom is a stand up guy.
I knew something wasn't right about that guy.
I knew there was something fishy about that guy.
Tom is a real decent guy.
Tom was green with envy.
Tom has been driving me crazy.
Don't let them tell you you're crazy.
My parents are crazy.
Please tell me it's crazy.
You're the one that went crazy.
It's normal for you to feel a bit woozy.
What's happening here at 2:30?
Where were you on 9/11?
Are you telling this story or am I?
I've hurt your feelings, haven't I?
I'll be OK as long as I stay awake, won't I?
I just need you to trust me, OK?
I'm going to be right there, OK?
Tell Tom I'll just be a minute, OK?
I don't want you to worry about anything, OK?
Let me finish, OK?
If you need something, just ask Tom, OK?
It scared me, too, OK?
Don't scare me like that, OK?
Let's just drop the subject, OK?
Let's talk this thing out, OK?
You just have to relax, OK?
Why all the drama?

Where are you posted?
Do you know if Tom was involved?

Are you that stupid?

Can we please get back to the problem at hand?
Why should we all stand?
What makes you think this is the end?
What are they going to find?
How many people did we leave behind?

Have I lost my mind?
Hey, Tom, can I talk to you over here for a second?
How should I respond?
How do I respond?
Listen, Tom, will you just stop shoving me around?
Why are you just sitting around?

Which is it going to be?
Tom, don't you have somewhere more important to be?
What did it turn out to be?
How long will that be?
What might that be?
How big will it be?
How lucky can one guy be?
Don't you have an interesting face?
What do you think of your own face?
How come I didn't know about this place?
The longer you live, the older you get.
Don't I know you from someplace?
Hey, Tom, do you still have that sofa-bed in your office?
Why didn't you tell this to the police?
Will you throw in some cables for that price?
See what happens when you give people advice?
Did that have any special significance?
How many of us get the chance?
Do we have any chance?
Is this Tom's residence?
How much do you know about artificial intelligence?
How many of these things have you made?
Who are you to decide?
Whatever happened to your pride?
Isn't Tom on your side?
How much do I owe you for the cup of coffee?
Can you make it safe?

This is kind of sudden, isn't it?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
That's the tricky part, isn't it?
That's the safest way, isn't it?
Where on earth did you get it?
Who could forget it?
Does that mean you bought it?
Did I blow it?
Didn't I tell you Tom would blow it?

Who else are we talking about?
So what were we talking about?
So what are you talking about?

Who do we see next?
Why does Tom need you?
Have they spotted you?
What do the rest of us have to do to convince you?
Did the phone wake you?
How do people like you get to be people like you?
How does that strike you?
You're not the police, are you?
You're not attracted to me, are you?
You're not a city girl, are you?
You're not one of them, are you?
You're not one of us, are you?
You're not really asking people to believe that, are you?
So how mad are you?
What kind of sick weirdo are you?
Just who are you?
Does Tom scare you?
How can I refuse you?
How could Tom hate you?
Why do I believe you?
What kind of shots did they give you?
Is that bothering you?
Don't you see that Tom is using you?
How much am I paying you?
Can I share something important with you?
What could Tom possibly want with you?
How do I thank you?
Am I supposed to thank you?
Did I ask you?
What do I call you?
What can I tell you?
Why do you think I didn't tell you?
Well, what does that tell you?
Get some help, will you?
Why should we harm you?
If anything happens here, can I depend on you?
You never stop, do you?
You never have any doubts, do you?
You don't have a lot to say, do you?
Do I look dead to you?
What would I do if something happened to you?
Can you tell us what happened to you?
Does this seem strange to you?
Does that seem strange to you?

I'm getting a bit confused.
Everyone's a bit confused.
I was totally confused.
Tom was utterly confused.
My curiosity was aroused.
It's a little complicated.
The first proposal was too complicated.
Well, it's complicated.
Everyone's life is complicated.

I think you've been infected.
That cut looks infected.
Tom was taller than I expected.

This is really awkward.
Come back here, you coward.

There's someone waiting for you in your office.
Tom went into Mary's office.
Tom might be in his office.

We know what you told the police.
Tom wasn't scared of the police.
Tom was caught by the police.
Stop trying to be nice.
I guess Tom was just trying to be nice.
You do look nice.
Tom wasn't nice.
Everyone's been really nice.
This place is really nice.
Tom is really awfully nice.
I think you've made the wrong choice.

There was no other choice.
Hunger is the best spice.
People might notice.
That's justice.
I think you've been getting bad advice.

My advice would be to ignore Tom's advice.
I've only seen Tom twice.
I'm not going to say this twice.
I was surprised when Tom asked me to the dance.
I don't want to go to the dance.
I thought Tom might ask Mary to the dance.
Thank you for your guidance.
I thought I'd take a chance.
At least give me a chance.
I should've kissed you when I had the chance.
Now is your chance.
Here's my chance.
Tom is a real nuisance.
Tom has no inheritance.
I should've paid in advance.
That's quite a coincidence.
It was too great a coincidence.
It was nothing but a coincidence.
It could be coincidence.
I climbed the fence.
I crawled under the fence.
I climbed over the fence.
The kids climbed over the fence.
I have a clear conscience.
Please don't lose patience.
There was total silence.
There was silence.
That made all the difference.
Tom won't know the difference.
It doesn't make much difference.
Tom was hard to convince.
I've only seen Tom once.
Tom might have been a teacher once.
I was young and ambitious once.
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary was asking him for a divorce.
We suspect that someone murdered Tom and just made it look like suicide.

There was nowhere we could hide.
I didn't know where to hide.
There was nowhere to hide.
Everyone has something to hide.
The police detective said that all of the doors and windows were locked from the inside.
Please go back inside.
I think we'd better stay inside.
The place was empty inside.
We waited outside.
There's someone waiting for me outside.
Let's see what's happening outside.
I want to eat breakfast outside.
We'll meet you outside.
I shouldn't have been so rude.
I think you've got a really bad attitude.
Bring me a cup of coffee.
I like a good cup of coffee.
Tom helped himself to coffee.
The drink I drink the most is coffee.
Tom doesn't like milk in his coffee.
I scraped my knee.
I hurt my knee.
I've got to be free.
Tom never would agree.
Tom might not agree.
I hope you agree.
I have to disagree.
I don't know how many years ago it was, but it was certainly more than three.
My car is older than this tree.
Try it and see.
I couldn't see.
Now you're safe.
I still think we're safe.
Let me put that somewhere safe.
I'll put it somewhere safe.
Tom never allowed Mary to see what was in his safe.
I wonder if Tom knows the combination to this safe.
You're perfectly safe.
