Interplanetary space is hardly tranquil. High-energy charged particles from the Sun, as well as from beyond our solar system, constantly whizz by. These can damage satellites and endanger astronaut health.
NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale mission, or MMS, launched in 2015, uses four identical spacecraft flying in a pyramid formation to take a three-dMMS, launched in 2015, uses four identical spacecraft flying in a pyramid formation to take a three-dimensional look at the magnetic environment around Earth.
Inside the magnetosphere, the density of the space plasma—charged particles, like electrons and ions—is much lower than the plasma outside, where the solar wind prevails. The boundary, called the magnetopause, becomes unstable when the two different density regions move at different rates.
Kelvin–Helmholtz waves are found across the universe wherever two materials of different density move past one another. They can be seen in cloud formations around Earth and have even been observed in other planetary atmospheres in our solar system.
One of the most spectacular achievements in physics so far this century has been the observation of gravitational waves, ripples in space-time that result from masses accelerating in space.
You sold us out.
So far, there have been five detections of gravitational waves, thanks to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and, more recently, the European Virgo gravitational-wave detector.
Most large galaxies have a central supermassive black hole.
When galaxies collide, their central black holes tend to spiral toward each other, releasing gravitational waves in their cosmic dance.
Much as a large animal like a lion produces a deeper roar than a tiny mouse's squeak, merging supermassive black holes create lower-frequency gravitational waves than the relatively small black holes LIGO and similar ground-based experiments can detect.
Pulsars are dense remnants of dead stars that regularly emit beams of radio waves, which is why some call them "cosmic lighthouses."
Because their rapid pulse of radio emission is so predictable, a large array of well-understood pulsars can be used to measure extremely subtle abnormalities, such as gravitational waves.
The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) is one of the leading groups of researchers using pulsars to search for gravitational waves.
In their heydays, the Mount Wilson 60-inch and 100-inch telescopes were the most powerful instruments of their kind.
Mount Wilson is the site where some of the key discoveries about our galaxy and universe were made in the early 20th century.
Since the 1970s, NASA has studied life from space with satellites.
Scientists have satellites along with observations from international spacecraft to conduct a wide range of research, from detecting northward expansion of forests in the Arctic to monitoring how burned areas recover from wildfires.
As trees grow, they absorb carbon from the atmosphere.
On any given day, Earth is about percent covered in clouds.
As plants take in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, they release water through evapotranspiration from their leaf pores, which helps them cool down in the hot sun.
If plants don’t get enough water, they can overheat.
Scientists have detected for the first time an interstellar asteroid passing through our solar system.
The asteroid, named ‘Oumuamua by its discoverers, is up to one-quarter mile (meters) long and highly-elongated—perhaps times as long as it is wide. That is unlike any asteroid or comet observed in our solar system to date, and may provide new clues into how other solar systems formed.
