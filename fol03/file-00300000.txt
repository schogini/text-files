That's worth repeating.
We happened to be in London at that time.
You shot yourself in the foot!
I want to play with the snow.
Do you desire to surprise your loved one tonight?
How many of you are alone tonight?
They were thrashed.
What are the grounds for denial?
Before we can file the claim, I need you to sign this.
Do we represent you?
We can't produce him as a witness.
Your Honor, I shall have to dismiss the entire panel.
Are we ready to proceed now with the jury selection?
Comparisons aplenty are being made.
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give in this cause, will be truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God?
You may take the stand.
You can't introduce evidence that way!
It's hearsay.
Does this document refresh your recollection?
Why don't we explain it to the jury?
Mr. Jackson, your rebuttal.
We the jury find for the plaintiff and award actual damages in the amount of one million dollars.
We award punitive damages in the amount of two million dollars.
Even the air's spicy here.
There isn't a single thing here that isn't spicy.
It has a leak.
It has a gap.
It has a flaw.
It has a seepage.
It has a chink.
Neither students nor teachers should ever stop learning.
Mandarin, English, and Arabic are all examples of the world's most widely spoken languages.
I don't understand a fucking thing.
Whether you like it or not, we have to do it that way.
Nobody ever does anything.
The Uyghurs' cuisine has all kinds of dishes.
You know what it is? Yes, jury duty, got a summons in the mail.
He's going to testify for us.
How familiar are you with my case?
Do you think it's a strong case?
Do you think it's a winning case?
I want her on my jury.
I got years of experience in courtrooms.
God save this state and this honorable court.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are now ready to begin the voir dire.
Court's adjourned.
Attorneys, both of you, see me in my chambers right now.
Do you feel that this lawsuit is frivolous?
They were complicit in those murders, and this I'll prove to you during the course of the trial.
Here's the deposition you needed.
Objection, Your Honor, this is all speculation.
They decided to fight mano-a-mano.
Why am I so alone?
You cannot translate the sentence word-for-word.
It's a racist thing to say.
Do you want to trade our two sheep, one for another?
Yana lives in London.
She is nice.
Did you really have sex?
The policemen searched one house after another in looking for the thief.
Are you a twin?
Who does she get that from?
Tom sometimes goes to Boston.
I have a twin brother.
I am a twin.
I have a twin.
When Darius saw that he would be overcome, he wanted to commit suicide in that battle.

They're sending help.
Is it true that Tom has a twin?
One word is enough for a wise man.
We acted in good faith.
I've lost faith in you.
There was a sudden drop in the temperature last night.
I don't know what his faith is.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
She reads nothing but fiction.
Few people realize it, but it's true.
I only know a few words.
Quite a few people are coming around to that way of thinking.
Is that story fact or fiction?
The fish in this river are few and far between.
I won't play second fiddle for anyone.
Let's cut across this field.
The teams are coming onto the field.
He's the best man in his field.
This writer spent several years in the field with the troops.
He gave me a fierce look.
How can you stand that fierce heat all day?
You're going to come up against fierce competition.
This bottle holds a fifth of a gallon.
He's the fifth man in line.
He's in his fifties.
Let's not start a fight.
Everybody suspected him of bribery.
We put up a good fight but we lost.
He hasn't got any fight left in him.
I can't make out these figures.
She has a nice figure.
He's one of the most important figures in modern literature.
How do you like this bronze figure I picked up in my travels?
Figure seven shows all the parts of the motor.
I figure it's about time we're going.
This didn't figure in my plans.
That's something I hadn't figured on.
Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.
Can you figure out this problem?
Figure up how much it amounts to.
Where should I file this correspondence?
I'll have time to file my nails while you're dressing.
I don't like modern films.
Do you have any film for this camera?
They filmed the entire ceremony.
How did you make out on your French finals?
This salve will act as a protective film over the burn.
He was eliminated before he got to the finals.
I don't want you to go alone; this is final.
Is that your final decision?
The country is in ruins, yet still there are mountains and rivers.
Can you find your way all right?
If he's convicted he'll have to pay a fine.
I finally found out where you were last night.
This pen has a very fine point.
Grind this coffee very fine.
There's no need of making such fine distinctions.
That was a mighty fine thing for him to do.
That's a fine way to treat a friend.
It's a fine day today.
I'm feeling fine, thanks.
The judge fined him five dollars.
He was given the finest education that money could buy.
That's fine!
I cut my finger peeling potatoes.
I know I have it, but I can't put my finger on it.
Were you there to see the finish?
This table has a nice finish.
Let's finish this job tonight.
Wait until I finish eating.
Will you light the fire?
That man was fired last week.
There was a big fire in the store.
The chimney caught on fire and the house burned down.
Wait until they open fire.
Better be careful, you're playing with fire.
That was no accident; someone set the house on fire.
Fire away!
How much fire insurance do you have?
Whose firm do you represent?
He has very firm convictions.
Do you remember the first time I came here?
He's always the first to complain.
The first good rain storm will wash it away.
I have to go to the store first.
First, let me ask you this.
The trees were torn up by the force of the storm.
We had to take him by force.
Which branch of the armed forces were you in?
The door has been forced.
We were forced to change our tactics.
We forced him to admit that he'd done it.
The plane made a forced landing.
He studied at a foreign university.
He has a prejudice against foreigners.
I'm afraid I'll be stuck in this place forever.
He's forever telling the same story.
It's raining, and we forgot to close the windows.
She's forgotten how to do it.
Could I have a knife and fork, please?
Turn left when you get to the fork in the road.
Is this a different word or just another form of the same word?
I play tennis, but my form is terrible.
You didn't finish filling out this form.
I haven't formed an opinion on that subject yet.
We had to attend just as a matter of form.
He's quite formal when he meets a stranger.
Did you make a formal agreement with him?
Of your two suggestions, I think I prefer the former.
He's a former student of mine.
He's a former president of the country.
He kept walking back and forth.
Six men came forward to volunteer for the work.
He was visiting his foster mother.
They did everything they could to foster good relations.
It was a foul play.
The air in here is foul.
That man has a foul mouth.
He was awarded a scholarship to do research for the foundation.
Three-fourths of the people of this town don't vote.
The foundation of this house is beginning to weaken.
The fracture wasn't as serious as we thought.
The boy fell off the bicycle and fractured his skull.
The frame of the house should be finished in a day or two.
I bought a leather frame for the picture.
I'd prefer a plain frame on these glasses.
He has a heavy frame.
They framed a constitution for the club.
Have you framed those pictures I brought in last week?
It's best not to leave her alone in that frame of mind.
He was framed on a murder charge.
You're free of all responsibility.
I don't have any free time today.
This is a free sample.
They held him for a few hours and then let him go free.
He wants us to free the prisoners.
When will he be freed?
Will you give me a free hand in the matter?
The game ended in a free-for-all.
The product is guaranteed to be free from defects.
That doesn't leave me much freedom of action.
Do you think the pond is frozen hard enough to skate on?
My feet are freezing.
He froze with fear when he saw the snake.
The cold froze the water in the pipes.
All funds are frozen until further notice.
I'm stuck in my job.
How much freight did you carry last trip?
How much is the freight on this box?
Do you like French wine?
I prefer the flavor of fresh-water fish.
I did my best to make friends with him.
He has a very friendly smile.
Our country has always had friendly relations with yours.
I just came from my house.
Take a clean glass from the cupboard.
Take a book from the shelf.
I live ten miles from the city.
Can you tell him from his brother?
I won't take such insults from anybody.
He was tired and nervous from overwork.
From what he says, I don't think we should go.
I saw it from the window.
From his point of view he's right.
He kept me from making a big mistake.
The front of the house is painted white.
He was at the front for three months.
Someone's at the front door.
My friend frowned as she read the letter.
The whole family frowned on the match.
Sometime I'll definitely visit France. I just don't know exactly when.
Give me a full glass of water.
I walked until my legs felt tired.
I'm so full I can't eat any more.
Humans are the only animals that can use fire.
That book is full of mistakes.
The dress has a full skirt.
Linda visited someone and still hasn't come back.
I don't see any fun in it.
We were just having a little fun.
That's not a very funny story.
I have a funny feeling.
We'll furnish you with everything you need.
How have you furnished your apartment?
Do you want to study it further?
The short circuit blew a fuse.
Who was that sitting in front of you at the movies?
Try to do better in the future.
This job has no future.
Introduce me to your future wife.
The bandits put a gag in his mouth.
Is this a gag?
We found him bound and gagged.
The invalid gagged on the heavy food.
Their loss is our gain.
There's been a recent gain in the population of the city.
My watch gains ten minutes a day.
His sincerity gained the confidence of everyone.
We have seats in the gallery.
We walked through a long gallery.
Give me five gallons of gas, please.
Don't gamble with other people's money.
He loves to gamble but generally loses.
He's gambling everything on the success of his son.
He looks upon his work as a game.
I saw through his game.
Is there any big game near here?
How long have you been in this game?
I'm game for anything.
He plays a good game.
The gangsters of the city were organized in gangs.
These flowers are from our garden.
I want to plant a vegetable garden.
Let's stop at the next station and gas up.
The crowd poured out through the gate.
He gathered up his things and left.
The crowd gathered around the speaker.
I gather you don't like him.
The car slowly gathered speed.
The sleeves are gathered at the cuff.
Is there an air gauge here?
Is there an air pressure gauge here?
Gauges are used to measure the thickness of wire.
The wind must be gauged accurately.
Be careful or you'll strip the gears.
We spent the afternoon cleaning our gear.
They're still around.
They're still available.
They're surrounding us.
They're under arrest.
They've found survivors.
They've got explosives.
They've got guns.
Things are changing.
Things are fine.

Things are tense.
Things got heated.

This changes things.
This disturbs me.
This doesn't count.
This doesn't help.

This sounds good.
This sounds healthy.
This sounds interesting.
This sounds reasonable.
This stuff works.
This stuff's awful.
This stuff's irreplaceable.
This stuff's radioactive.
This was fun.
This was good.

Was it serious?
Was it thrilling?
Was that helpful?
Wash the car.
Wash the dishes.
Wasn't that fantastic?
Wasn't that fun?
Watch and learn.
Watch me now.
Watch the door.
Watch the prisoner.
Watch them closely.
Watch your head.
Watch your mouth.
We'll do something.
We'll get caught.
They hold a general election every year.
Be generous; don't think only of his faults.
I moved into a new apartment.
He's certainly generous with his money.
This restaurant serves generous portions.
The nurse has very gentle hands.
There was a gentle knock on the door.
He was rowing against a gentle current.
Isn't he a gentle person?
Don't work too much!
The attempt failed.
That dog is very gentle.
This way, gentlemen!
He made a gesture with his hand.
His work was merely a gesture of good will.
He gestures when he speaks.
When did you get my letter?
Can you get me another pencil?
Can you get him to come to the theater?
They got him elected Mayor.
We've got enough.
I'll get there in an hour.
I'll go and get the book tomorrow.
I couldn't get him by phone.
Wait till I get my hat.
For an old man he gets about very well.
Finally I was able to get the meaning across.
Those two don't get along.
I'll get along somehow.
It's late and I'll have to be getting along.
He's certainly getting along in years.
He gets around a lot.
The story will get around in a few hours.
Can you get around that regulation?
She gets around him.
I can't get at my luggage.
Some day I'll get at the real reason.
I want to get away from the noise.
I'm sure I can get away with it.
How can I get back at him?
Can I get by the guard?
Do you think I can get by with it?
I'll get by if I have a place to sleep.
I'll get fired if they find out.
He'll be able to get the work going.
What time does the train get in?
Please get the clothes in before it rains.
Get in touch with me.
Did you get in with our crowd?
I can't get my shoes off.
Please get off the couch.
I'll get off with very light punishment.
He's getting old.
Don't get on the train yet.
Let's get on with the meeting.
How are you getting on?
The three of us get on very well.
He can't even write his own name.
We mustn't let this news get out.
How much did you get out of the deal?
How did you ever get out of it?
I got over my cold quickly.
How did you get over the difficulty?
When are you going to get dinner ready?
Get it out of the house.
They got to be good friends.
Let's get together tonight at my house.
They never seem to get together on anything.
I get up at seven every morning.
I don't want to get my feet wet.
He got off to a flying start.
Do you get the idea?
I got angry.
We've got to leave early.
I worked a bit at my computer.
All my clothes have gotten dirty since I've been here.
There will be a giant crop of corn this year.
Thank you for the Christmas gift.
He has a gift for drawing.
The woman gave birth to a baby girl.
Are there any pretty girls in town?
Is there a TV in your bedroom?
Why do you like Hawaii?
Fly, thought, on wings of gold; // go settle upon the slopes and the hills, // where, soft and mild, the sweet airs // of our native land smell fragrant!
Well, girls, it's time to go.
I just got a letter from my girl.
Please give me the letter.
Who's giving the main speech?
Be careful! The step might give under your weight!
I don't give a damn.
