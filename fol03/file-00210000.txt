Here, you have translated from the sentence in < the language you have translated from > and you created a link to that one. I think this is the sentence in < the language you want to translate from > that you wanted to translate. To do this, you must first click on the sentence in < the language you want to translate from > before clicking on the translation button. The sentence that you are translating must ALWAYS stand on top of the pile (in the largest typeface) and it is the only one visible at the time you're editing your translation, and that is on purpose to avoid influence on your translation, as in Tatoeba, sentences are linked by twos, not as blocks, since a sentence may have several different translations in the same language!

God then wanted to test Abraham's obedience, and called out his name.
'Take your only begotten son Isaac, whom you love, quickly go to the land of vision, and sacrifice him there upon a mountain.'
Abraham then arose in the same night, and went with two servants to the distant land, together with Isaac, riding on donkeys.
And, to top it all off, he can read Hebrew.
Then on the third day, when they saw the mountain where they had to go to slay Isaac, then Abraham said to those two servants thus:
'You wait here with the donkeys for a while. I and the child will go to pray and we will come again immediately to you.'
Abraham then ordered Isaac to bring the wood to the place, and he himself brought his sword and fire.
Isaac then asked his father Abraham:
My father, I ask where the offering is; here is the wood and fire.
His father answered, 'God will provide, my son, the offering for himself.'
They came to the place that was revealed to him by God, and he there erected an altar in the ancient manner, and the wood was arranged just as he wanted to have it happen for his son's burning after he slayed him.
He then bound his son, and took up his sword, in order to sacrifice him in the ancient manner.
Just when he was beginning the task, the angel of God called out from the heavens, 'Abraham!' He answered immediately.
The angel then said to him: 'Do not kill your child, nor should your hand stretch out over his neck!'
'Now that I have realized that you truly fear God, now that you would slay your only begotten son for him.'
Then Abraham looked immediately behind and saw a ram between the brambles, caught by the horns, and he lifted up the ram to the offering, and he slaughtered it there as a sacrifice to God instead of his son Isaac.
He then named the place Dominus videt, that is, 'God sees', and yet said so, In monte Dominus videbit, that is, 'God sees on the mountain'.
I swear to me himself, said the Almighty, now that you would not spare your only begotten son,
But that your fear of me was greater than his life, now I bless you and your offspring, just so that they multiply like the stars in the heavens and just as grains of sand on the sea.
'Your offspring shall possess their enemies' gates, and in your seed shall be all nations blessed because you obeyed my command thus.'
Abraham then immediately returned to his servants and so they went home with heavenly blessing.
