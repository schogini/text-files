There are some things that are difficult to translate.
Some things are perhaps not worth translating.
Tom felt that it would be a waste of time to translate the letter for Mary.

It's easy to quit smoking. I've done it hundreds of times.
I don't beat them.

The jagged mountains were capped with snow.

Tom is the name of my black tomcat.

That's where we saw Tom last year.
That's wonderful.
That's your job.
That's your problem.
You have to be strong.
You must be strong.
I expected better of you.
I expected better of him.
I expected better of her.
Why don't you look for a job?
Why is this happening?
There's no danger.
How does he know that?
How does she know that?
Sound the alarm!
I had to make a decision.
I have to make a decision.
It belongs to me.
He wants to be different.
She wants to be different.
I just want to be different.
It's easy to remember.
How long have you been traveling?
You might as well go home.
Why is Tom still standing outside in the rain?
Where's Tom from?
Whenever I cook spaghetti noodles, I set an egg timer.
When I was younger, I thought I could do anything.
When I opened the door, Tom was standing there wearing a suit.
When I first met Tom, I was eighteen.
What's the title of the book you're reading?

What surprised me was that Tom didn't know Mary.
What surprised me was that only ten people came to Tom's funeral.
What happened was out of Tom's control.
What happened was out of my control.
What did Tom do with the money?
What could they possibly tell us that we don't already know?
What are the chances that Tom will actually come?
What are the chances of that happening?
What a perfect night!
Welcome to Boston.
We'll never have to do this again.
We sure ate a lot of hot dogs today. I never want to see another hot dog as long as I live.
We need to do things differently.
We might as well wait until Tom gets here.
We might as well go ahead and do that now.
We might as well ask Tom to come, too.
We have to get that document back before Tom shows it to anyone.
We have a long ways to go.
We hardly ever see each other anymore. We might as well be strangers.
Warn Tom that Mary is looking for him.
Warn me never to go there again.
Unless Tom is sober, I don't want him helping us.
Unfortunately, I missed all the fun.
Trust is earned.
Tom is the kind of guy that a girl could fall in love with.
Tom carved his initials on the large oak tree in front of the school.
Three of Tom's friends went to Mary's party.
Those are nice.
Those are mine.
This would be a lot easier if you would help.
This wasn't an easy decision for us.
This was all a mistake.
This time we won.
This smells bad, but it tastes good.
This should be interesting.
This seems risky.
This place is packed.
This place is creepy.
This one's yours.
This one's Tom's.
This movie is supposed to be very good.
This job is kind of boring.
This isn't possible.
This isn't possible without Tom's help.
This isn't funny.
This isn't for you.
This isn't as hard as it looks.
This isn't as easy as it looks.
This isn't a party.
This isn't a joke.
This is your last chance.
This is weird.
This is very fresh.
This is useless.
This is the third time I've heard this song today.
This is the second time Tom has been here this week.
This is the only way to get Tom to stop.
This is the last time I'm going to tell you this.
This is the last piece of cake.
This is the best.
This is the best guitar in the store.
This is suicide. We shouldn't be attempting to do this.
This is so weird.
This is ridiculous.
This is really bad.
This is perfect.
This is not good.
This is not a game.
This is my wife.
This is my son.
This is my place.
This is my phone.
This is my painting.
This is my husband.
This is my grandfather.
This is my fault.
This is my baby.
This is easy. It's like taking candy from a baby.
This is creepy.
This is all our fault.
This is a very profitable business.
This is a nice place.
This is a nice place for a picnic.
This is a joke.
This is a good place to pitch a tent.
This doesn't seem to make sense.
This doesn't make sense.
Think of all the fun you've been missing.
They've had plenty of time.
They're with me.
They're stalling.
They're not a threat.
They're lying.
They're gone.
They're expensive.
They're cool.
They're coming.
They're armed.
They're all scared of Tom.
They'll take care of Tom.
They won't tell us anything.
They want to have a meeting with you.
They took Tom away on a stretcher.
They think you killed Tom and took his money.
They ruined it.
They never did an autopsy.
They might not notice that Tom isn't here.
They haven't hurt me.
They didn't even know why they were supposed to go.
They didn't even know who they were supposed to meet.
They didn't even know where to go.
They didn't even know what to do.
They didn't even know what they were looking at.
They didn't even know what they had found.
They didn't even know we were there.
They didn't even know how to write their own names.
They deported Tom.
They are probably all dead now.
These are the originals.
These are beautiful.
There's still time.
There's something Tom isn't telling Mary.
There's something Tom hasn't told Mary.
There's something moving in the next room.
There's really nothing else to say.
There's only one way to find out how to do that. Ask Tom.
There's no way to know who's coming.
There's no way to know how much that will cost.
There's no need to be gentle.
There's no need to ask for permission.
There's no blood on the floor.
There's a warrant out for your arrest.
There's a guy in there with a gun. I need backup.
There's a fine line between what's acceptable and what's unacceptable.
There's a fine line between what's acceptable and what's not.
There's a fine line between love and hate.
There's a fine line between genius and stupidity.
There's a fine line between genius and insanity.
There's a fine line between being frugal and being cheap.
There's a call for you. It's Tom.
There were three women standing at the bar.
There were almost no cars in the parking lot.
There was a tap at the door.
There was a stack of newspapers in the corner of the room.
There was a bullet hole in the windshield.
There must be some mistake.
There must be another way we can help Tom.
There must be a way we can convince Tom to work for us.
There may be another way to do this.
There is one problem.
There is nothing I can do to change that.
There is no other explanation.
There is a crowd of women around Tom.
There are only two correct answers.
There are many things worse than death.
There are a bunch of kids playing on the street just outside my window.
The two women look at Tom and then at each other.
The three of them all just looked at Tom.
The supermarket didn't have what I wanted.
The sun is setting.
The students pretended that they couldn't hear the teacher.
The street outside Tom's apartment building was quiet.
The shirt you gave me fit perfectly.
The room was quiet.
The room is empty.
The radio is on.
The police showed me your picture.
The police have been following me.
The police found Tom's body in a shallow grave behind the barn.
The police aren't after us anymore.
The police are not here to arrest you.
The phone stopped ringing.
The phone rang and Tom answered it.
The parking lot is nearly empty.
The parking lot is almost empty.
The only question now is how we're going to get home.
The only question now is how we're going to get enough money to pay our bills.
The old man in the wheelchair told me that he knew my mother when she was a teenager.
The next time you do that, you're fired.
The man carrying a violin seemed upset.
The man at the door wouldn't tell me his name.
The lid is closed.
The last time I saw Tom, he was ranting about something.
The gun isn't loaded.
The fugitive is armed and dangerous.
The first time Tom brought Mary home, his mother said, "This one's a keeper."
The fireman chopped his way through the door.
The elevator doors wouldn't open.
The doctor told Tom that he only had six months to live.
The choice is yours.
The campfire is still burning.
The bartender kicked Tom out of the bar.
The bartender didn't even card me.
That belongs to me.
Thanks for the help.
Thanks for the cake.
Thanks for that.
Thanks for saving my life.
Thanks for picking me up.
Thanks for dinner.
Thanks for coming over.
Thanks for calling. I was just about to call you.
Thanks for believing in me.
Thank you for calling Tom.
Thank you for being my friend.
Sometimes I get jealous.
Something's wrong.
Something's come up, so I can't attend today's meeting.
Something very unusual seems to be happening in the park.
Something must have gone wrong.
Something is wrong.
Something is still not right.
Someone's outside.
Someone's in the shower.
Someone's in the next room.
Someone told me you left your husband.
Someone told me Mary left her husband.
Someone else might want your old desk if you don't want it anymore.
Some animals are afraid of fire.
So you decided to come after all.
See you tomorrow afternoon.
See you guys later.
Practically every guy in the bar was looking at Mary.
Please use the bathroom downstairs.

Tom didn't expect to encounter a human being in a place where a squirrel would have thought twice about entering.
They're all dead! All dead! All dead!
I prefer your eau de vie to your conversation.
I prefer your brandy to your conversation.
"But what will happen to Mary while I'm gone?", said Georgina anxiously.
When Tom came back from this long trip he seemed not to enjoy his home country anymore.
Alert! Tom, open your eyes, something is going on at the beach.
"Are you sure it's a human bone?", said Tom while putting his shoes back on.
Tom had told the sailors what had happened.
Throw him in the water!
What! Holk had a son? But he was not married.
We went bear hunting together the other day.
My father is boneheaded, and when he has an idea, everything is decided: there's nothing more we can do.
We need a steamboat.
Would there be traitor among us?
The island was therefore a sure haven for all criminals who had run from the law.
Mary, even though the daughter of a mere farmer, has manners that betray a distinguished upbringing.
What do you call this beautiful young man who came with these ladies?
God! What a beard you have! You look terrible! You're going to scare away the children.
The first victim was one of my best friends and his loss caused me a great deal of grief; the second victim was merely a German.
Be careful, don't remove the cap. It's arsenic!
The nice young man, in order to avoid embarrassing questions, presented the crazy woman as his sister.
This woman had the task of cleaning the cabin, and not of taking care in the evenings of the mental health of the passengers.
Now, my young man, jump out the window!
I would like to know if he knows that Mary lives near here.
The matter is more serious than you think.
Tom, my friend, I know that you loved me, but I could not be yours.
Give me that bottle. This "brandy" tastes good; where does it come from?
"Mary, will you answer my question?" asked Ad√®le while trying to control her excitement.
All of a sudden, the door opened and a man entered the room.
Man, if he is not the largest, is certainly the most dangerous of ferocious animals. He kills for pleasure.
In the name of God, protect me from this crazy woman!
Quick! Quick! I hear footsteps, hide!
Mary, you poor child, where have you been? What happened to you?
Let me put on my glasses since I can't hear you.
Is it so difficult to write?
It's annoying.
It's annoying to hear people talking loudly in a library.
That loud music is annoying.
That's annoying.
Is this annoying?
Am I annoying you?
That sound is extremely annoying.
That's pretty annoying.
That's an annoying habit.
Do you find that annoying?
I'm not annoying anyone, am I?
Tom seems to find that annoying.
I told you Tom was really annoying.
Tom is just as annoying as Mary.
I can see how that might be annoying.
It's just one of those annoying buzzwords.
You're starting to get really annoying.
That's the most annoying song I've ever heard.
It doesn't annoy me.
It doesn't bother me.
A slow-worm is a limbless lizard, not a snake.
The two of you are the most annoying people I've ever met.
You're just as annoying as you were the last time I met you.
There were a lot of annoying insects flying around.
There's nothing more annoying than a group of young girls all trying to talk at the same time.
A slowworm is a limbless lizard, not a snake.
Tom seems to be annoyed.
Tom seems to be annoyed with himself.
Tom seems to be slightly annoyed.
That sound annoyed me at first, but now I've gotten used to it.
Tom was annoyed by Mary's silence.
There are mosquitoes even in Greece.
What an idiot!
False friends are pairs of words in two languages that are similar in spelling or pronunciation, but differ in meaning.
Bow to no man.
Judging from the expression on her face, she was worried.
Tom wanted to find out who the artist was who was playing violin in such a manner in an Arkansan forest.
The money that he had been promised was not, according to him, a sufficient reward for such a service.
Does the snake not bite when we step on it?
Property prices are going up.
"It seems that you know the country well." "I think so," answered Tom, smiling.
Oh, I love life in the woods, declared Tom suddenly after a long silence, while he was relaxing on his blanket.
Ah! my dear girl, I would love to see you become the wife of a good farmer and be one of our neighbours.
When I said that I had killed a panther with nothing but a knife, this means that I did not have any dogs with me and that I did not use a rifle.
Well, Bill, I am pleased to see you here.
There's something in the face of this man that's repugnant and that I do not like; moreover, I would say that I am inclined to hate him.
Ah! you're trying to escape, vile creature! you're trying to escape like a thief, in the middle of the night, eh?
Adele watched her friend with dismay. Large tears flooded her face, she could not suppress this scream of anguish and pity: "Oh! Mary! poor Mary!".
Mary was sleeping; she was still wearing her torn white dress, and her long black hair, resting in a dishevelled manner upon her shoulders, contrasted strongly with the paleness of her face.
Tom was a wonderful boy, who had gained the affection and esteem of all.
You men, you're all selfish and heartless, and us women, who are always loving and compassionate, we're forced to obey you!
Tom reluctantly let Mary into his house.
You're starting to annoy me.
Tom was annoyed at the interruption.
Tom seems more annoyed than angry.
Tom seems really annoyed.
Tom seems uncomfortable and annoyed.
Tom slammed the door shut just to annoy Mary.
Tom had an annoyed look on his face.
You're really on time.
It's just midnight.
Thanks for being on time.
Tell them to hurry up.
I think I hear them.
Has this thing appeared again tonight?
It's all in your imagination.
Tom says it's all in our imagination.
It's so annoying!
Tie him to a tree.
Whip him until he confesses.
She was convinced that Pierre knew more than he wanted to confess.
We should talk calmly to each other.
It reminds me of a certain someone...
He reminds me of somebody.
She reminds me of someone.
I don't know which child is yours.
I don't know what her intentions are.
Who is able to explain this to me?
I can explain what‚Äôs on the grapevine.
Do you know how it feels to translate a hundred similar variations of a sentence?
Thus we were urged into a fight.
He has gathered an army of lawless criminals.
He has gathered a small army of volunteers.
I think it can be no other reason but that.
She wants something very special for her birthday.
Ah! how polite and gallant men are when they're trying to obtain something from a poor woman!
"Murder!", screamed the poor woman in a loud shriek.
And those were her last words.
And those were his last words.
How am I supposed to know where she's hiding her money?
We must absolutely find the assassins.
You are loved and missed throughout the world, man.
I must give my respects.
Does your language have a word for "exobiology"?
Seize this brigand! Prevent him from escaping!
Don't mention the war!
The city of Rome is famous.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
I love your daughter.
I love her daughter.
I love his daughter.
I love your son.
I love her son.
I love his son.
Tom is an art dealer.
Does your father know?
Does your mother know?
What time is your train?
What time is your plane?
What time is your bus?
Well, that was quick!
He came too fast.
He came really fast.
He came quickly.
The young man came running to meet her.
It took less than five minutes.
It took less than five minutes for me to write that letter.
It took slightly more than five minutes for Tom to read the pamphlet.
We only use 10% of our brain.
I love Tom.
How could it be?
How can it be?
How long has he been dead?
How bad can it be?
Harry is a wizard.
Harry put on his robe and wizard hat.
It's simpler and more reliable.
This car is more reliable than a Lada.
I taught my wife how to drive.
I taught my girlfriend how to drive.
I taught my sister how to drive.
I taught Tom how to drive.
She taught me how to drive.
It was an eye-opening experience.

This car has a good warranty.
"Tom will be here soon." "How soon?"
"Will you buy it for me?" "Buy what?"
"Everybody is invited." "Even Tom?"
"Please go there now." "Go where?"
Did she say something?
Did he say something?
"Why did Tom do that?" "Beats me."
"Why did Tom do that?" "I have no idea."
"Why did Tom do that?" "I don't know."
"Why did Tom do that?" "Do what?"

Do you want to look at it?
Does he want to look at it?
Does she want to look at it?
There's something I have to tell you.

I can't take this any longer.
She couldn't take it any longer.
He couldn't take it any longer.
You can't go in there!
I can't take it any longer.
He's a southpaw.
Sadly, Tom doesn't read books.
Wake up Tom.
Don't mess with me!
Don't mess with me, Tom!
Truer words have never been spoken.
I think I can prove it.
He thinks he can prove it.
She thinks she can prove it.
You're such a liar.

This is not a shortcut; this is private property.
Just a little bit.
Tom spent all morning in the interrogation room.
The policeman aimed his gun at Tom and yelled, "Hold it right there!"
I will buy a car next month.
This box is very heavy.
"Would you like me to put some cream in your coffee?" "Yes, just a little bit."
Tom does not know the difference between a diamond and an emerald.
She was banished for life.

Mary had not suspected that the young farmer liked her; she loved him as a brother.
I understand everything now and I regret that Tom is not here with me now.
"What happened to you, Mary?" asked Tom while carrying the poor crazy woman to the back.
Georgina bit her lips until they bled.
It's now the season when cheetahs like to chase after herds of deer and when wild turkeys gather into rafters and go cluck together.
This man's behaviour is mysterious and suspect.
She opened the door and invited the young farmer in.
You're white as a ghost. Are you sick?
She had killed her first husband with the help of the second one. They had done it with a nail that they pushed together into his temples while he was sleeping.

Peach trees require lots of sunshine.

Every man has a right to life; and this means that he has also a right to make a comfortable living.
Every man has a right to his own property.
We must build toward the time when a major depression cannot occur again; and if this means sacrificing the easy profits of inflationist booms, then let them go; and good riddance.
Democracy is a quest, a never-ending seeking for better things, and in the seeking for these things and the striving for better things, and in the seeking for these things and the striving for them, there are many roads to follow.
Some of my friends tell me that they do not want the Government in business. With this I agree; but I wonder whether they realize the implications of the past. For while it has been American doctrine that the government must not go into business in competition with private enterprises, still it has been traditional particularly in Republican administrations for business urgently to ask the government to put at private disposal all kinds of government assistance.
The same man who tells you that he does not want to see the government interfere in business‚Äîand he means it, and has plenty of good reasons for saying so‚Äîis the first to go to Washington and ask the government for a prohibitory tariff on his product.
A glance at the situation today only too clearly indicates that equality of opportunity as we have know it no longer exists.
It still is true that men can start small enterprises, trusting to native shrewdness and ability to keep abreast of competitors; but area after area has been preempted altogether by the great corporations, and even in the fields which still have no great concerns, the small man starts with a handicap.
Put plainly, we are steering a steady course toward economic oligarchy, if we are not there already.
I am very sorry you have a cold and are in bed. I played with Mary today for a little while. I hope by tomorrow you will be able to be up. I am glad today that my cold is better.
Mr. Esperanto is well, isn't he?
