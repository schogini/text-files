Coral reefs are home to millions of species.
Coral reefs teem with life.
Many U.S. coral reefs were alive and thriving centuries before the European colonization of the nearby shores.
Today, these important habitats are threatened by a range of human activities.
Many of the world’s reefs have already been destroyed or severely damaged by water pollution, overfishing and destructive fishing practices, disease, global climate change, and ship groundings. However, we can still protect and preserve our remaining reefs by acting now.
The giant bumphead parrotfish is an amazing fish that can live to be years old, growing up to four feet long and pounds.

Sand comes from many locations, sources, and environments.
Sand forms when rocks break down from weathering and eroding over thousands and even millions of years.
Rocks take time to decompose, especially quartz and feldspar.
Often starting thousands of miles from the ocean, rocks slowly travel down rivers and streams, constantly breaking down along the way. Once they make it to the ocean, they further erode from the constant action of waves and tides.
Don't you think that's a little premature?
The tan color of most sand beaches is the result of iron oxide, which tints quartz a light brown, and feldspar, which is brown to tan in its original form.
Black sand comes from eroded volcanic material such as lava, basalt rocks, and other dark-colored rocks and minerals, and is typically found on beaches near volcanic activity.
Black-sand beaches are common in Hawaii, the Canary Islands, and the Aleutians.
The by-products of living things also play an important part in creating sandy beaches. Bermuda's preponderance of pleasantly pink beaches results from the perpetual decay of single-celled, shelled organisms called foraminifera.
Mary raised her eyebrows.
The famous white-sand beaches of Hawaii, for example, actually come from the poop of parrotfish. The fish bite and scrape algae off of rocks and dead corals with their parrot-like beaks, grind up the inedible calcium-carbonate reef material (made mostly of coral skeletons) in their guts, and then excrete it as sand.

One may be satisfied that there are no senses apart from the five from the following arguments.
For all those things which are qualities of the tangible object, qua tangible, we perceive by touch.
If we currently have perception of everything for which the sense is touch it is also necessary that, lacking some sense, we will also lack some sense organ.
For the hope of the wicked is as dust, which is blown away with the wind, and as a thin froth which is dispersed by the storm: and a smoke that is scattered abroad by the wind: and as the remembrance of a guest of one day that passeth by.

The Mississippi River carries millions of tons of nutrient-rich sediment into the Gulf each year.
You're a quick study.
Sixty-five percent of U.S. estuaries and coastal water bodies are moderately to severely degraded by excessive nutrient inputs, which lead to algal blooms and low-oxygen (hypoxic) waters that can kill fish and seagrass and reduce essential fish habitats.
Eutrophication is a big word that describes a big problem in the nation's estuaries.
The primary culprits in eutrophication appear to be excess nitrogen and phosphorus—from sources including fertilizer runoff and septic system effluent to atmospheric fallout from burning fossil fuels—which enter waterbodies and fuel the overgrowth of algae, which, in turn, reduces water quality and degrades estuarine and coastal ecosystems.
The mid-ocean ridge is the longest mountain range on Earth.
The mid-ocean range stretches around the globe like the seam of a baseball.
The longest mountain range on Earth is called the mid-ocean ridge. Spanning 40,miles around the globe, it's truly a global landmark.
About percent of the mid-ocean ridge system is under the ocean.
About percent of the mid-ocean ridge system is under the ocean. This system of mountains and valleys criss-crosses the globe, resembling the stitches in a baseball. It's formed by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates.
As the Earth's crust spreads, new ocean floor is created. This process literally renews the surface of our planet.
If you look at a map of the world's volcanoes, you'll find that most of them form along the boundaries of this great system. In fact, the global mid-ocean ridge system forms the largest single volcanic feature on the Earth.
The mid-ocean ridge consists of thousands of individual volcanoes or volcanic ridge segments which periodically erupt.
What percentage of the American population lives near the coast?
In 2010, 123.million people, or percent of the United States’ population lived in counties directly on the shoreline.
In the United States, counties directly on the shoreline constitute less than percent of the total land area (not including Alaska), but account for percent of the total population. From to 2010, the population of these counties increased by almost 40%.
Coastal areas are substantially more crowded than the U.S. as a whole, and population density in coastal areas will continue to increase in the future.
The population density of coastal shoreline couhe population density of coastal shoreline counties is over six times greater than the corresponding inland counties.
The majority of marine protected areas in the United States are multiple-use sites, meaning fishing, boating, surfing, diving, and other recreational activities are allowed.
The highest tide in the world is in Canada.
The highest tides in the world can be found in Canada's Bay of Fundy.
Tom typed furiously on his keyboard.
Tom thinks Mary won't be suspicious.
The highest tides in the world can be found in Canada at the Bay of Fundy, which separates New Brunswick from Nova Scotia.
At some times of the year the difference between high and low tide in the Bay of Fundy is 16.meters, taller than a three-story building.
The highest tides in the United States can be found near Anchorage, Alaska, with tidal ranges up to 12.meters.
Tidal highs and lows depend on a lot of different factors. The shape and geometry of a coastline play a major role, as do the locations of the Sun and Moon.
Detailed forecasts are available for high and low tides in all sea ports, but are specific to local conditions.
That many of the areas of the world with high ranges of tides are in the areas of Alaska, Canada, and northern Europe has created a misconception that the range of tide increases with increasing latitude (as one moves farther from the equator and closer to the poles). This is incorrect.
In the higher latitudes of the northern hemisphere, the continents of North America, Europe, and Asia are pressed closer together. This “constriction” of the oceans creates the effect of a higher range of tides.
The greatest number of the Earth's volcanoes occur on the ocean floor.
Most volcanoes are found along a belt, called the “Ring of Fire” that encircles the Pacific Ocean.
You're insulting my intelligence.
Estuaries experience change many times a day due to tides.
Sixty percent of all active volcanoes occur at the boundaries between tectonic plates.
Located at the northern end of the Ten Thousand Islands on the gulf coast of Florida, the Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve represents one of the few remaining undisturbed mangrove estuaries in North America.
Because of tides, the water levels in an estuary are going up and down several times a day.
Estuarine organisms can adapt quite well to changing conditions in estuaries. For example, fish or crabs are mobile and can move as needed throughout the day to adjust to changes in the estuary.
Mangroves are a group of trees and shrubs that live in the coastal intertidal zone.
Don't give them any ideas.
Estuaries are home to unique plant and animal communities that have adapted to brackish water.
We must find a way to stop him.

There are about different species of mangrove trees.
Mangrove forests only grow at tropical and subtropical latitudes near the equator because they cannot withstand freezing temperatures.
Many mangrove forests can be recognized by their dense tangle of prop roots that make the trees appear to be standing on stilts above the water.
This tangle of roots allows the trees to handle the daily rise and fall of tides, which means that most mangroves get flooded at least twice per day. The roots also slow the movement of tidal waters, causing sediments to settle out of the water and build up the muddy bottom.
Mangrove forests stabilize the coastline, reducing erosion from storm surges, currents, waves, and tides.
The intricate root system of mangroves makes these forests attractive to fish and other organisms seeking food and shelter from predators.
Covering approximately million square miles and containing more than half of the free water on Earth, the Pacific is by far the largest of the world’s ocean basins.
All of the world’s continents could fit into the Pacific basin.
National marine sanctuaries are protected waters that include habitats such as rocky reefs, kelp forests, deep-sea canyons, and underwater archaeological sites
Within national marine sanctuaries's protected waters, giant humpback whales breed and calve their young, temperate reefs flourish, and shipwrecks tell stories of our maritime history.

Maritime heritage resources, when properly studied and interpreted, add an important dimension to our understanding and appreciation of our nation’s rich maritime legacy, and make us more aware of the critical need for us to be wise stewards of our ocean planet.
The largest marine sanctuary is located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument is not only the largest conservation area in the U.S., it's one of the largest marine conservation areas in the world.
This marine conservation area is home to many rare and endangered species such as the green sea turtle and the Hawaiian monk seal.
The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the world's five ocean basins.
With an area of about 5.million square miles, the Arctic Ocean is about 1.times as big as the United States. It is bordered by Greenland, Canada, Norway, Alaska, and Russia.
The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is 12,feet and it is 17,feet at its deepest point.
The Arctic Ocean is almost completely covered with ice for the majority of the year and its average temperature seldom rises above freezing.
Tunnels within sea ice called brine channels house bacteria and algae that feed flatworms and other tunnel-dwelling creatures.
When the creatures below the ice die, they sink to the bottom of the ocean and provide nutrients for sponges, sea anemones, and other bottom dwelling creatures.
The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument is larger than all of America’s national parks combined!
The Bermuda Triangle is a region in the western part of the North Atlantic Ocean in which ships, planes, and people are alleged to have mysteriously vanished.
What is it? You don't look happy.
Some speculate that unknown and mysterious forces account for the unexplained disappearances within the Bermuda Triangle, such as extraterrestrials capturing humans for study; the influence of the lost continent of Atlantis; vortices that suck objects into other dimensions; and other whimsical ideas.
Melting ice forms ponds on top of the ice that develop into biological communities.

In 2016, on days they worked, percent of employed persons did some or all of their work at home, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today.
Marine sanctuary managers use a combination of science, education, and enforcement to protect marine life
The majority of Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes pass through the Bermuda Triangle, and in the days prior to improved weather forecasting, these dangerous storms claimed many ships. Also, the Gulf Stream can cause rapid, sometimes violent, changes in weather.
The large number of islands in the Caribbean Sea creates many areas of shallow water that can be treacherous to ship navigation.
There is some evidence to suggest that the Bermuda Triangle is a place where a “magnetic” compass sometimes points towards “true” north, as opposed to “magnetic” north.
The ocean has always been a mysterious place to humans, and when foul weather or poor navigation is involved, it can be a very deadly place.
There is no evidence that mysterious disappearances occur with any greater frequency in the Bermuda Triangle than in any other large, well-traveled area of the ocean.
There are about twice as many coral species in Pacific Ocean reefs as in Atlantic Ocean reefs.
The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States.
The Chesapeake watershed spans 64,squares miles, covering parts of six states — Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Over million people live in this area.
The estuary and its network of streams, creeks, and rivers hold tremendous ecological, cultural, economic, historic, and recreational value for the region.
More than fish species use the Chesapeake Bay and tributaries for some portion of their life cycles, including American and hickory shad, river herring, striped bass, eel, weakfish, bluefish, flounder, oysters, and blue crabs. More than migratory bird species can also be found in the watershed.
Seabirds are impacted by a variety of human-related activities including oil spills, fisheries interactions, contaminants, disturbances, and habitat destruction.

In 1519, Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan, in the employ of Spain, began a journey across the Atlantic Ocean to seek a western route to the Spice Islands via South America.
Tell me you still love me.
After braving perilous seas and navigating through what are now known as the Straits of Magellan, Magellan's small fleet entered an unfamiliar ocean in Nov. 1520. He called this body of water pacific, due to the calmness of the water at the time ('pacific' means peaceful).
When Magellan and his crew entered the Pacific Ocean after their long journey, they thought that the Spice Islands were close at hand. Little did they know that their destination remained thousands of miles away. The explorers had ventured into the largest ocean on Earth.
The Atlantic Ocean covers an area of approximately 41,105,square miles.
Tom put some red satin sheets on his bed.
The Atlantic Ocean borders the east coast of the U.S., while the Pacific borders the U.S. West Coast.
Covering approximately percent of the Earth’s surface, the Atlantic Ocean is the second largest ocean basin in the world, following only the Pacific.
The Atlantic Ocean is only slightly larger than half the size of the Pacific Ocean.
The North Atlantic, where waters sink after being chilled by arctic temperatures, is the start of the “global ocean conveyor,” a circulation pattern that helps regulate Earth’s climate.

While there are many different types of algae found floating in the ocean all around world, the Sargasso Sea is unique in that it harbors species of sargassum that are holopelagic. This means that the algae not only freely floats around the ocean, but it reproduces vegetatively on the high seas. Other seaweeds reproduce and begin life on the floor of the ocean.
A moose licked Tom's face while he was sleeping.
Sargassum provides a home to an amazing variety of marine species.

Oceanic and atmospheric Rossby waves — also known as planetary waves — naturally occur largely due to the Earth's rotation. These waves affect the planet's weather and climate.
Unlike waves that break along the shore, Rossby waves are huge, undulating movements of the ocean that stretch horizontally across the planet for hundreds of kilometers in a westward direction.
Rossby waves, also known as planetary waves, naturally occur in rotating fluids. Within the Earth's ocean and atmosphere, these waves form as a result of the rotation of the planet.
A King Tide is a popular, non-scientific term people often use to describe exceptionally high tides.
Sea level rise at specific locations may be more or less than the global average due to many local factors: subsidence, upstream flood control, erosion, regional ocean currents, variations in land height, and whether the land is still rebounding from the compressive weight of Ice Age glaciers.
Sea level is primarily measured using tide stations and satellite laser altimeters.
Global sea level has been rising over the past century, and the rate has increased in recent decades.
In 2014, global sea level was 2.inches above the average.
The two major causes of global sea level rise are thermal expansion caused by warming of the ocean (since water expands as it warms) and increased melting of land-based ice, such as glaciers and ice sheets.
With continued ocean and atmospheric warming, sea levels will likely rise for many centuries at rates higher than that of the current century.
In the United States, almost percent of the population lives in relatively high-population-density coastal areas, where sea level plays a role in flooding, shoreline erosion, and hazards from storms.
Globally, eight of the world's largest cities are near a coast, according to the U.N. Atlas of the Oceans.
Roads, bridges, subways, water supplies, oil and gas wells, power plants, sewage treatment plants, landfills—virtually all human infrastructure—is at risk from sea level rise.
Are all fish cold-blooded?
The opah is the only known fully warm-blooded fish that circulates heated blood throughout its body.
Not all fish are cold-blooded.
In 2015, researchers with the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center revealed the opah, or moonfish, as the first fully warm-blooded fish.
Although not as warm as mammals and birds, the opah circulates heated blood throughout its body, giving it a competitive advantage in the cold ocean depths from to 1,feet below the surface.
The best time to plant a tree was years ago. The second best time is today.
"This restaurant has a perfect diarrhea score for me," said Tom. "I think it's five for five now."
The opah is equipped with specialized blood vessels that carry warm blood to its gills to rewarm the blood that cools as the fish breathes and absorbs oxygen from the water.
The opah is one of the most colorful of the commercial fish species, and is particularly popular in Hawaii.
The opah's overall red with white spots and turns a silvery-grey when it dies.
The opah's fins are crimson, and its large eyes are encircled with gold.
Where do fish go when it freezes outside?
Most fish slow down and "rest" near the bottom during cold winter months.
Have you ever wondered how fish survive in cold winter weather, or where they go when lakes and ponds freeze over?
Like many people, fish tend to be less active in the cold.
The layer of ice that forms on top of a lake, pond, river, or stream provides some insulation that helps the waterbody retain its heat.
Because warm water sinks in very cold freshwater, fish often gather in groups near the bottom.
If you've ever gone ice fishing, you know that a long line, a slow, colorful lure, and a hearty portion of patience are often required to land this quiet quarry!
Just like the human "snowbirds" who fly south for the winter, saltwater fish often cruise to warmer climes when the mercury plummets.
With the exceptions of the polar regions, salty ocean water rarely freezes.

Sailors call the latitudes between and degrees south of the equator the Roaring Forties.
During the Age of Sail, the strong prevailing winds of the Roaring Forties propelled ships across the Pacific, often at breakneck speed.
Cape Horn, located at the southern tip of South America, is one of the most treacherous sailing passages in the world.
The Roaring Forties take shape as warm air near the equator rises and moves toward the poles.
Westerly winds are prevailing winds that blow from the west toward the east.
Trade winds are winds that blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere.
While the Roaring Forties may be fierce, degrees south are even stronger gale-force winds called the Furious Fifties. And degrees south of the Furious Fifties lie the Screaming Sixties!
We can thank the intrepid sailors of yore for these wildly descriptive terms.
The horse latitudes are subtropical regions known for calm winds and little precipitation.

What are the oldest living animals in the world?
Studies show that some corals can live for up to 5,years, making them the longest living animals on Earth.
Some corals can live for up to 5,years, making them the longest living animals on Earth.
Scientists are now using a genetic approach to estimate the ages of corals. The method determines when a coral egg and sperm originally met to form the genome of a coral colony. The researchers then track the number of mutations that have accumulated in the genome since that time. Because mutations tend to arise at a relatively constant rate, researchers can estimate the approximate age of the coral genomes in their study.
Elkhorn corals are listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.
A tide gauge measures changes in sea level relative to a datum (a height reference).
The rise and fall of the tides play an important role in the natural world.
A tide gauge, which is one component of a modern water level monitoring station, is fitted with sensors that continuously record the height of the surrounding water level.
I don't know what she sees in you.

Essentially a giant measuring stick, the tide staff allowed scientists to manually observe tidal levels.
The computer age led to tide gauges that use microprocessor-based technologies.
Early commerce to the Americas relied on the trade winds—the prevailing easterly winds that circle the Earth near the equator.
Known to sailors around the world, the trade winds and associated ocean currents helped early sailing ships from European and African ports make their journeys to the Americas.
The trade winds also drive sailing vessels from the Americas toward Asia.
Even now, commercial ships use "the trades" and the currents the winds produce to hasten their oceanic voyages.
The colorful hues of icebergs result from the interplay of light with dense ice, ice crystals, and algal growth.
Most people would say that icebergs are white—and most of them are. But did you know that icebergs can also appear in spectacular shades of blue and green?
An iceberg looks white because compressed snow on its surface contains large numbers of tiny air bubbles and crystal edges that equally reflect all wavelengths of visible light.
When light encounters the dense, compressed ice, the ice absorbs longer wavelengths of colors, such as red and yellow, but colors of shorter wavelengths, like green and blue, are reflected. This is what gives some icebergs their remarkable colors.
I'm just getting warmed up.
Don't you think you're overreacting?
Tom acted irrationally.
Mary was acting irrationally.
Are corals animals or plants?
Coral, a sessile animal, relies on its relationship with plant-like algae to build the largest structures of biological origin on Earth.
Corals are sessile animals that "take root" on the ocean floor. It's no wonder that many people think corals are plants!
Corals are sessile, which means that they permanently attach themselves to the ocean floor, essentially "taking root" like most plants do.
Corals are animals because they do not make their own food, as plants do. Corals have tiny, tentacle-like arms that they use to capture their food from the water and sweep into their inscrutable mouths.
Most structures that we call "coral" are, in fact, made up of hundreds to thousands of tiny coral creatures called polyps. Each soft-bodied polyp—most no thicker than a nickel—secretes a hard outer skeleton of limestone (calcium carbonate) that attaches either to rock or the dead skeletons of other polyps.
In the case of stony or hard corals, these polyp conglomerates grow, die, and endlessly repeat the cycle over time, slowly laying the limestone foundation for coral reefs and giving shape to the familiar corals that reside there. Because of this cycle of growth, death, and regeneration among individual polyps, many coral colonies can live for a very long time.
Most corals contain algae called zooxanthellae which are plant-like organisms.
Residing within the coral's tissues, the microscopic algae are well protected and make use of the coral's metabolic waste products for photosynthesis, the process by which plants make their own food.
The corals benefit, in turn, as the algae produce oxygen, remove wastes, and supply the organic products of photosynthesis that corals need to grow, thrive, and build up the reef.
This mutual exchange is the reason why coral reefs are the largest structures of biological origin on Earth, and rival old-growth forests in the longevity of their ecological communities.
I've wanted this for so long.
I don't know the city very well.
I'm so happy for you and Tom.
I think Tom's going to faint.
I've wanted to do this for so long.
You mustn't do that.
Climate change and ocean acidification can result in mass coral bleaching events, increased susceptibility to disease, slower growth and reproductive rates, and degraded reef structure.
There are no quick fixes when it comes to a changing climate.
Climate change is the single greatest global threat to coral reefs.
Healthy coral reefs support an amazing diversity of marine life and are often called the rainforests of the sea.

He began to kiss her gently.
I should have told you this long ago.
Why did you wait so long to kiss me?
Stony corals reproduce by releasing their eggs and sperm all at the same time. This spawning cycle is one of nature’s most spectacular events.
Corals are a beautiful and important part of our ocean.
Once a year, on cues from the lunar cycle and the water temperature, entire colonies of coral reefs simultaneously release their tiny eggs and sperm, called gametes, into the ocean.
In ways that scientists still do not fully understand, mature corals release their gametes all at the same time. This synchrony is crucial, because the gametes of most coral species are viable for only a few hours. The “blizzard” makes it more likely that fertilization will occur.
When a coral egg and sperm join together as an embryo, they develop into a coral larva, called a planula. Planulae float in the ocean, some for days and some for weeks, before dropping to the ocean floor. Then, depending on seafloor conditions, the planulae may attach to the substrate and grow into a new coral colony at the slow rate of about .inches a year.
I've wanted to say it for so long.
No flies enter a closed mouth.
Many coastal and island communities depend on coral reef fisheries for their economic, social, and cultural benefits.
Unsustainable fishing on coral reef areas can lead to the depletion of key reef species in many locations.
Scientific evidence now clearly indicates that the Earth's atmosphere and ocean are warming, and that these changes are primarily due to greenhouse gases derived from human activities.
As temperatures rise, mass coral bleaching events and infectious disease outbreaks are becoming more frequent.
Increased greenhouse gases from human activities result in climate change and ocean acidification.
A warming ocean causes thermal stress that contributes to coral bleaching and infectious disease.
Ocean acidification refers to a reduction in the pH of the ocean over an extended period of time, caused primarily by uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
For more than years, or since the industrial revolution, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased due to the burning of fossil fuels and land use change.
The ocean absorbs about percent of the CO₂ that is released in the atmosphere.
When CO₂ is absorbed by seawater, a series of chemical reactions occur resulting in the increased concentration of hydrogen ions. This increase causes the seawater to become more acidic and causes carbonate ions to be relatively less abundant.
Decreases in carbonate ions can make building and maintaining shells and other calcium carbonate structures difficult for calcifying organisms such as oysters, clams, sea urchins, shallow water corals, deep sea corals, and calcareous plankton.
Ocean acidification is affecting the entire world’s oceans, including coastal estuaries and waterways.

Many aquatic animals use sound to find prey, locate mates and offspring, avoid predators, guide their navigation and locate habitat, and listen and communicate with each other.
Over the last century, human activities such as shipping, recreational boating, and energy exploration have increased along our coasts, offshore, and deep ocean environments. Noise from these activities travel long distances underwater, leading to increases and changes in ocean noise levels.
Rising noise levels can negatively impact ocean animals and ecosystems.
Higher noise levels can reduce the ability of animals to communicate with potential mates, other group members, their offspring, or feeding partners.

A thermocline is the transition layer between warmer mixed water at the ocean's surface and cooler deep water below.
In the thermocline, temperature decreases rapidly from the mixed upper layer of the ocean (called the epipelagic zone) to much colder deep water in the thermocline (called the mesopelagic zone).
Bodies of water are made up of layers, determined by temperature. The top surface layer is called the epipelagic zone, and is sometimes referred to as the "sunlight zone."
It is relatively easy to tell when you have reached the thermocline in a body of water because there is a sudden change in temperature.
Below 3,feet to a depth of about 13,feet, water temperature remains constant.
At depths below 13,feet, the water temperature ranges from near freezing to just above the freezing point of water as depth increases.

Scientists hypothesize that Europa's hidden ocean is salty, tidal, and causes its ice surface to move, resulting in large fractures which are visible on its surface.

The International Date Line serves as the "line of demarcation" between two consecutive calendar dates.
The International Date Line, established in 1884, passes through the mid-Pacific Ocean and roughly follows a degrees longitude north-south line on the Earth.
The International Date Line is located halfway round the world from the prime meridian—the zero degrees longitude established in Greenwich, England, in 1852.
When you cross the date line, you become a time traveler of sorts! Cross to the west and it’s one day later; cross back and you’ve "gone back in time."
While the date line generally runs north to south from pole to pole, it zigzags around political borders such as eastern Russia and Alaska’s Aleutian Islands.
Water temperature and pressure determine how far sound travels in the ocean.
While sound moves at a much faster speed in the water than in air, the distance that sound waves travel is primarily dependant upon ocean temperature and pressure.

Waves are created by energy passing through water.
The ocean is never still.
Waves transmit energy, not water, across the ocean and if not obstructed by anything, they have the potential to travel across an entire ocean basin.
Waves are most commonly caused by wind.
Wind-driven waves, or surface waves, are created by the friction between wind and surface water.
As wind blows across the surface of the ocean or a lake, the continual disturbance creates a wave crest.
A wetland is an area of land that is saturated with water.
Wetland habitats serve essential functions in an ecosystem, including acting as water filters, providing flood and erosion control, and furnishing food and homes for fish and wildlife.
During periods of excessive rain, wetlands absorb and slow floodwaters, which helps to alleviate property damage and may even save lives.
Wetlands also absorb excess nutrients, sediments, and other pollutants before they reach rivers, lakes, and other waterbodies.
Wetlands are also great spots for fishing, canoeing, hiking and bird-watching.
Aquaculture is the breeding, rearing, and harvesting of fish, shellfish, plants, algae and other organisms in all types of water environments.
