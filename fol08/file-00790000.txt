I expect that Tom will wait until Mary gets there before he starts doing that.
You didn't do that very well.
Tom seemed to be unperturbed.
Tom knew Mary was the one who had done that, even though she said she didn't.
You didn't do that correctly.
Tom seemed to be unimpressed.
Tom and Mary couldn't do that by themselves, so they asked John to help them.
You aren't a barber, are you?
Tom seemed to be unconvinced.
Tom was the only other person who didn't eat any of the salad that Mary made.
Would you mind if I don't go?
Tom seemed to be unconscious.
Tom probably shouldn't have told Mary that he'd spent three years in prison.
Would you ever eat a hamster?
Tom seemed to be unconcerned.

What time do you want to eat?
Tom seemed to be pessimistic.

What kind of car did you buy?
Tom seemed to be overwhelmed.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was glad that that was going to happen.
What kind of bait do you use?
Tom seemed to be nice enough.
Tom and Mary won't know whether they can do that or not unless they try.
What else do you want to buy?
Tom seemed to be intoxicated.
Didn't you know Tom used to win every time he played chess against Mary?
What does that remind you of?

What does that actually mean?
Tom seemed to be incompetent.

Tom seemed to be happy again.
I wonder whether Tom has ever asked Mary why she dropped out of school?

We won't do that without you.
Tom seemed to be daydreaming.
Tom told Mary that John wouldn't eat the stew if it had carrots in it.
We wanted to travel together.
Tom seemed to be comfortable.
Last year, Tom wasn't as fat as Mary, but now he's fatter than she is.
We thought you could do that.
Tom seemed to be celebrating.
I wonder why Tom waited so long before he told Mary what had happened.

Tom would've done that if Mary hadn't done it for him yesterday.
We should get some more food.
Tom seemed to always be busy.

Today I get off work at 2:30.
Tom seemed a little hesitant.
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary already knew about what had happened.
This room isn't large enough.
Tom says he's heard you sing.
Tom thought Mary might not want to do that on a cold day like today.
This movie isn't interesting.
Tom says he'll do that again.
Tom says Mary will stay with her grandparents in Boston next summer.
This is a pear, not an apple.
Tom says he doesn't ever win.
I think Tom will eventually give up and ask Mary to do that for him.
There's no way I can do that.

It'll take about three hours.
