At Tatoeba it is necessary that all sentences are equivalent and natural. Therefore, for example, a French translation of an English sentence should not only be faithful, in order to be useful to an Englishman who is studying the French language, but also so that it can be learned as a model sentence by students of French throughout the world.

The invention of the telescope in the early 1600s revolutionized astronomy.
Galileo was one of the first to use the telescope to search the heavens. Among his findings was spotting the four largest moons orbiting around Jupiter.
Using the Hooker Telescope — the largest telescope of its day — at Mt. Wilson Observatory in California, astronomer Edwin Hubble found that some nebulae, such as the Andromeda nebula, were separate galaxies like our own Milky Way galaxy.
Henrietta Swan Leavitt discovered the relation between the luminosity and the period of Cepheid variable stars.
The first extrasolar planet, Pegasi b, was discovered by astronomers Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva, using the ELODIE spectrograph on the Observatoire de Haute-Provence telescope in France.

In 2006, scientists launched the French CoRoT mission, the first space mission dedicated to the extrasolar planet hunt. The mission helped astronomers discover dozens more extrasolar planets.
Another step forward in the search for extrasolar planets began with the launch in of the Kepler space observatory, NASA's first extrasolar mission. Kepler's goal was to search hundreds of thousands of stars for signs of planets.
Kepler has found a diverse array of planets, including exotic, multi-planet solar systems.
Kepler has found that smaller planets (Earth-sized rather than Jupiter-sized) are likely to be the most common in the Milky Way galaxy.
Kepler uncovered several planets that are about the same size as Earth and orbit within the star's habitable zone, where liquid water, which is necessary for life, can exist.
Overall, Kepler has added more than 1,confirmed planets to the extrasolar planet count, which now stands at nearly 3,700.
Astronomers also have used NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, which observes in infrared light, to study extrasolar planets. In 2007, the Spitzer telescope detected water vapor for the first time on another world.
Hubble made one of the first visible-light images of an extrasolar planet circling the nearby, bright star Fomalhaut, located light-years from Earth.
Hubble also helped astronomers analyze the atmospheres of extrasolar planets.
Hubble made the first measurements of the makeup of the atmospheres of two Jupiter-sized extrasolar planets.
Even if a planet is rocky, Earth-sized, and just the right distance from its star, it also must have an atmosphere that contains the correct ingredients to foster and sustain life.
Venus is Earth's twin by size, but its dense atmosphere is made up mostly of carbon dioxide, which helps keep the planet sizzling hot. Venus, therefore, is not hospitable for life.
You better watch your back.
Mary has a nose piercing.
I was extremely naive at the time.
The distant worlds observed by Hubble and other telescopes are just the tip of the iceberg, according to a Hubble survey of the center of our Milky Way. The study revealed that our galaxy should be brimming with billion planets, at least one planet for every star.
NASA's New Horizons mission, for example, was the first spacecraft to visit Pluto in the outer solar system. The spacecraft’s images of Pluto show a surprisingly complex world with giant ice mountains that had never been seen before.
The study of worlds outside our solar system will be continued by future spacecraft, such as NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and James Webb Space Telescope.
TESS will find planets in the same manner as Kepler, but search stars that are closer to our sun.
The Webb telescope will use infrared light to examine in detail the extrasolar planetary systems found by TESS and other telescopes.
The James Webb telescope will study the chemical makeup of extrasolar planets' atmospheres.
Who knows what new discoveries these observatories will uncover?
I still have feelings for him to this day.
I still have feelings for her to this day.
Tom is a charismatic politician.
About percent of the planets that ever will form are yet to be born.
With roughly billion planets in our galaxy, billion galaxies in the universe, and trillions of years ahead, planet studies in the universe have vast possibilities across both space and time.
About a million years ago, an icy comet began its journey from its home in our distant solar system, hundreds of times farther out than any planet. Now, the comet has finally reached our inner solar system neighborhood as it follows its long path around the Sun.
Comet Siding Spring was discovered in by astronomers at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia.
Since Comet Siding Spring's discovery, astronomers have observed it with many telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope.
Hubble images taken in October and March show two jets of dust coming from the comet's core, or nucleus.
The Sun's heat warms the comet's ice, turning it into gas that is blown off as jets.

The comet created excitement among astronomers because it passed very close to Mars.
In 1994, two dozen pieces of Comet Shoemaker-Levy smashed into Jupiter. The collision didn't damage the planet, but it left behind black scars in Jupiter's clouds.
We spoke about an article that I had published.
More than a century ago, a comet or a meteor exploded in the sky above the Tunguska River valley in Russia. The explosion knocked down millions of trees over hundreds of miles.
More than million years ago, a large comet hit Earth, leading to the demise of the dinosaurs and most of the planet's other species.

Do you want me beg?
Tom was too afraid to talk.

Many of the famous comets are short-period comets, which orbit the Sun in less than years.
The Kuiper Belt is a broad region beyond the orbit of Neptune containing perhaps million small objects made of ice and rock.
Comet Siding Spring is one of the long-period comets, those that require more than years to orbit the Sun. These comets come from the Oort Cloud, a sphere of about a trillion ancient, icy objects located hundreds to thousands of times farther than the planets' orbits.
Every year astronomers observe comets that come from the distant solar system and travel back out again.
The Oort Cloud is so far away from the Sun that its icy objects are not warmed much by the Sun's heat. The objects are frozen fossils from the early solar system.
Once Comet Siding Spring leaves the inner solar system, it will not come back for a couple million years.
Four of the seven planets orbiting the nearby star Trappist-might contain large quantities of water.
Trappist-is located just light-years away from Earth.

In his book, Huygens described Saturn as being "surrounded by a thin flat ring."
The discovery of Saturn's mysterious ring system led to a rush of observations of the planet during Huygens' time.
Today, astronomers are still studying Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, in an attempt to understand the planet and its ring system.
Other planets have rings, but they are so faint that we cannot easily see them.
Saturn's rings stand out because they are very bright and contain lots of material. Their brightness is due to their makeup. The rings are made of icy material that reflects sunlight, just as ice does on Earth.
Saturn and its ring system are so special that three spacecraft have visited the planet over the past years to take some close-up views.
Saturn, like Jupiter, is a gas giant and does not have a solid surface.
The first spacecraft to fly by Saturn was Pioneer in the late 1970s.
In the early 1980s, Voyager and flew by the ringed planet.
The planet's ring system is made up of about 10,rings, called ringlets.
Saturn's ring system is about 175,miles (280,km) across, yet only about half a mile (km) thick.
Compared with Saturn's size, the rings appear paper-thin.
Astronomers believe the rings are made of pieces of dusty water ice, which range in size from dust grains to boulders. These particles gently collide with each other as they go around Saturn.
The rings orbit Saturn just as our Moon goes around the Earth.
If our Moon broke apart, the pieces would form a ring around our planet.
At least 100,rocky objects called asteroids reside between Mars and Jupiter.
The board of directors held an emergency meeting.
The small wisdom is like water in a glass: clear, transparent, pure. The great wisdom is like the water in the sea: dark, mysterious, impenetrable.
It all started innocently enough.
Scientists believe that asteroids are the leftover building blocks of our solar system planets.
These space rocks orbit the Sun in a large, circular region called the asteroid belt.
The Dawn spacecraft will first visit Vesta in 2011. After orbiting Vesta for nine months, Dawn then will travel to Ceres, arriving in 2015.
My mom will kill me if she finds out.
Tom won the Pulitzer prize.
The spacecraft’s many science instruments will study the asteroids’ surface features, their varied landscapes, and perhaps even their internal structure.

There is certainly no absolute standard of beauty. That precisely is what makes its pursuit so interesting.
Politics is not the art of the possible. It consists in choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable.
People are the common denominator of progress. So, paucis verbis, no improvement is possible with unimproved people, and advance is certain when people are liberated and educated.
Meetings are a great trap. They are indispensable when you don't want to do anything.
Complexity is often a device for claiming sophistication, or for evading simple truths.
In any great organization it is far, far safer to be wrong with the majority than to be right alone.
One must always have in mind one simple fact — there is no literate population in the world that is poor, and there is no illiterate population that is anything but poor.
We can safely abandon the doctrine of the eighties, namely that the rich were not working because they had too little money, the poor because they had too much.
We now in the United States have more security guards for the rich than we have police services for the poor.
It is my guiding confession that I believe the greatest error in economics is in seeing the economy as a stable, immutable structure.
Let's begin with capitalism, a word that has gone largely out of fashion. The approved reference now is to the market system. This shift minimizes — indeed, deletes — the role of wealth in the economic and social system. And it sheds the adverse connotation going back to Marx. Instead of the owners of capital or their attendants in control, we have the admirably impersonal role of market forces. It would be hard to think of a change in terminology more in the interest of those to whom money accords power.
The modern conservative is engaged in one of man's oldest exercises in moral philosophy; that is, the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness.
Some years, like some poets, and politicians and some lovely women, are singled out for fame far beyond the common lot, and was clearly such a year.
No one was responsible for the great Wall Street crash. No one engineered the speculation that preceded it. Both were the product of free choice and decision of hundreds of thousands of individuals.
The values of a society totally preoccupied with making money are not altogether reassuring.
Of all the mysteries of the stock exchange there is none so impenetrable as why there should be a buyer for everyone who seeks to sell.
Despite a flattering supposition to the contrary, people come readily to terms with power. There is little reason to think that the power of the great bankers, while they were assumed to have it, was much resented. But as the ghosts of numerous tyrants, from Julius Caesar to Benito Mussolini will testify, people are very hard on those who, having had power, lose it or are destroyed. Then anger at past arrogance is joined with contempt for the present weakness. The victim or his corpse is made to suffer all available indignities.
A banker need not be popular; indeed a good banker in a healthy capitalist society should probably be much disliked. People do not wish to trust their money to a hail-fellow-well-met but to a misanthrope who can say no.

Income from this source is exempt from taxes.
Regulatory bodies, like the people who comprise them, have a marked life cycle. In youth they are vigorous, aggressive, evangelistic, and even intolerant. Later they mellow, and in old age—after a matter of ten or fifteen years—they become, with some exceptions, either an arm of the industry they are regulating or senile.
Income from this source is free of taxes.
Wealth is not without its advantages, and the case to the contrary, although it has often been made, has never proved widely persuasive.
The enemy of the conventional wisdom is not ideas but the march of events.
Ideas are inherently conservative. They yield not to the attack of other ideas but to the massive onslaught of circumstance with which they cannot contend.
Even the word depression itself was the terminological product of an effort to soften the connotation of deep trouble. In the last century, the term crisis was normally employed.

Among all the world's races, some obscure Bedouin tribes possibly apart, Americans are the most prone to misinformation.
The positions of eminence and authority in Congress are allotted in accordance with length of service, regardless of quality. Superficial observers have long criticized the United States for making a fetish of youth. This is unfair. Uniquely among modern organs of public and private administration, its national legislature rewards senility.
The foresight of financial experts was, as so often, a poor guide to the future.
People of privilege will always risk their complete destruction rather than surrender any material part of their advantage. Intellectual myopia, often called stupidity, is no doubt a reason. But the privileged also feel that their privileges, however egregious they may seem to others, are a solemn, basic, God-given right. The sensitivity of the poor to injustice is a trivial thing compared with that of the rich.
People of privilege will always risk their complete destruction rather than surrender any material part of their advantage.

Of all classes, the rich are the most noticed and the least studied.
Money is a singular thing. It ranks with love as man's greatest source of joy. And with death as his greatest source of anxiety.

The privileged have regularly invited their own destruction with their greed.
There is merit even in the mentally retarded legislator. He asks the questions that everyone is afraid to ask for fear of seeming simple.
All of the great leaders have had one characteristic in common: it was the willingness to confront unequivocally the major anxiety of their people in their time. This, and not much else, is the essence of leadership.

I naturally gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained.
The cops are behind us!
I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought.
So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living.
I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile.
The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man.
"Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?" he asked in undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.

"Poor devil!" he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my misfortunes. "What are you up to now?"

Immigration can be a controversial topic. We all want safe, secure borders and a dynamic economy, and people of goodwill can have legitimate disagreements about how to fix our immigration system so that everybody plays by the rules.
These Dreamers are Americans in their hearts, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper. They were brought to this country by their parents, sometimes even as infants. They may not know a country besides ours. They may not even know a language besides English. They often have no idea they’re undocumented until they apply for a job, or college, or a driver’s license.
And because it made no sense to expel talented, driven, patriotic young people from the only country they know solely because of the actions of their parents, my administration acted to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people, so that they could continue to contribute to our communities and our country.
Our immigration enforcement agencies have limited resources, and it makes sense to focus those resources on those who come illegally to this country to do us harm.
But today, that shadow has been cast over some of our best and brightest young people once again.
To target these young people is wrong – because they have done nothing wrong.
To target these young people is wrong – because they have done nothing wrong. It is self-defeating – because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love. And it is cruel.
What if our kid’s science teacher, or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a Dreamer? Where are we supposed to send her? To a country she doesn’t know or remember, with a language she may not even speak?
Whatever concerns or complaints Americans may have about immigration in general, we shouldn’t threaten the future of this group of young people who are here through no fault of their own, who pose no threat, who are not taking away anything from the rest of us.
Kicking them out won’t lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyone’s taxes, or raise anybody’s wages.
It is precisely because this action is contrary to our spirit, and to common sense, that business leaders, faith leaders, economists, and Americans of all political stripes called on the administration not to do what it did today.
Ultimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we’d want our own kids to be treated. It’s about who we are as a people – and who we want to be.
What makes us American is not a question of what we look like, or where our names come from, or the way we pray. What makes us American is our fidelity to a set of ideals – that all of us are created equal; that all of us deserve the chance to make of our lives what we will; that all of us share an obligation to stand up, speak out, and secure our most cherished values for the next generation.
That’s how America has traveled this far. That’s how, if we keep at it, we will ultimately reach that more perfect union.

Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.

He seized me by the coat sleeve in his eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been working.
"Let us have some fresh blood," he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette.

Gravity doesn't just exist on Earth. It also affects objects in space.
Without gravity, a satellite launched from the Earth would simply drift off endlessly into space, traveling in a straight line, instead of circling the planet.
Weight and mass are not the same.
Mass is a measure of a body's resistance to changes in its state of motion, which depends on the amount of matter it contains.
Weight is the force of gravity exerted on a body due to its mass and its location near another, more massive object.
An astronaut in space can be weightless but cannot be without mass.
Eros, named for the god of love, is a near-Earth asteroid, which often comes close to our planet.
Eros is the first asteroid to be landed upon by a spacecraft.
Ida was the second asteroid to be observed close-up by a spacecraft, when the Space Probe Galileo took pictures as it flew by on Aug 28, 1993. These pictures showed not only that Ida has a cratered surface, but also that it has a small moon, called Dactyl, which is about 1.x 1.km in diameter and orbiting km away from the asteroid.
Ida's moon, Dactyl, is probably made from pieces that broke off Ida during an impact.
Comet Hale-Bopp has a very large nucleus.
Halley is perhaps the most famous comet in history.
Halley is the comet that proved correct Edmund Halley's prediction that it would reappear.
Comet Halley is responsible for depositing the debris that, when falling through Earth's atmosphere, causes the Orionid meteor showers.
Halley has a highly elongated orbit that takes it very close to the Sun and then flings it out into the outer solar system, well past the orbit of Pluto.
Tom and Mary had a fling.
Eris is the largest known dwarf planet in the solar system. Its elongated orbit takes it far outside of the main region of the Kuiper Belt.
While hurricanes and other violent weather occur frequently on our planet, thankfully, we don’t encounter them every day.
Imagine waking up every day to hurricane-force winds of miles per hour sweeping across the planet, or harmful sulfuric acid rain falling on a scorching hot planet! These kinds of wild weather are routine occurrences on some of our solar-system planets and moons.
While hurricanes and other violent weather occur frequently on our planet, thankfully, we don’t encounter them every day. Our solar-system neighbors, however, are not so lucky.

Pluto can reach temperatures of minus degrees Celsius.
Rain waters our plants and keeps our grass green.
Some parts of the world, such as the Sahara Desert in Africa, receive very little rain. Others, such as India during the late summer monsoon season, can be subject to widespread flooding.
Some of our solar-system neighbors have rain, too, but it is not made up of water, as it is on Earth.
Venus has continuous showers of sulfuric acid rain. However, the acid rain evaporates before it reaches Venus's surface because of the planet's super-hot temperatures.
That sounds like the perfect place for a vacation.
Titan, Saturn's largest moon, has rain that is made up of frigid liquid methane, hitting a bitterly cold surface, where the temperature is minus degrees Fahrenheit.

Powerful winds on Earth can uproot trees, toss over cars, and destroy houses.
Every single day, 200-mile-per-hour winds whip around Jupiter.
Storms on Jupiter have been clocked at over miles per hour.
Clouds on Saturn can reach speeds of 1,miles an hour.
Strong winds can kick up dust storms in dry regions, such as the Sahara Desert.
Large dust storms have swept through the Sahara Desert in North Africa, turning day into night and making it hard to breathe and see.
Dust shrouded Mars for three months before fading away.
In 2005, a massive 400-mile-wide hurricane named Katrina struck New Orleans, La., and neighboring states.
The storm packed winds of to miles per hour, toppling homes and causing widespread flooding.
Katrina, however, cannot compare to a colossal hurricane on Saturn.
The Great Red Spot is a storm larger than Earth that has been raging for hundreds of years.

The highest mountain in the world is Mt. Everest in Nepal, rising more than 8,metres into the sky.
The moon has mountains, too.
The Moon's Mons Hadley Delta is 15,feet tall, and makes up part of the rim of a deep crater from an asteroid impact billions of years ago.
The volcanic mountains on Mars rise up to five times higher than Mt. Everest.
Pluto, located on the outskirts of our solar system, has a different kind of mountain range, made up of ice. The ice mountains are about 11,feet tall. The New Horizons spacecraft spotted them for the first time when it flew by the dwarf planet in July 2015.
Scientists are still making new discoveries in our solar system.
The Grand Canyon, located in the northwest corner of Arizona, was carved out millions of years ago by water.
The Grand Canyon is one mile deep and about miles long.
The deepest canyon in the world is the Tsangpo Canyon, along the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet. The canyon is almost 3.miles deep and is slightly longer than the Grand Canyon.
The Valles Marineris canyon on Mars is even deeper and much longer than Tsangpo Canyon, measuring miles deep and stretching about 3,miles across, which is about the width of the continental U.S.
History has recorded many violent volcanic eruptions on Earth.
In 1991, Mt. Pinatubo's volcanic outburst in the Philippines produced the second largest eruption of the 20th century. Ash from the blast was ejected as high as miles above Earth. Particles from the eruption created a layer of sulfuric acid haze in Earth's atmosphere, dropping global temperatures by nearly degree Fahrenheit between and 1993.
Volcanoes on other solar system planets are much larger and much more active than those on Earth.
Olympus Mons, an inactive volcano on Mars, spreads over an area as large as the state of Arizona.
Jupiter's moon, Io, has more than active volcanoes, making it the most geologically active object in the solar system. Several volcanoes on Io produce plumes of sulfur and sulfur dioxide that rise as high as miles above its surface.
Rivers are plentiful on Earth, and each river has a connection of streams that all flow into it. Some of Earth's solar-system neighbors show evidence that they once had similar river systems.
Observations of Mars, Venus, and Titan reveal a series of thin channels that lead to larger channels. Although now dry, these channels could have once been river systems.
Like Earth, Mars has both northern and southern polar ice caps.
Earth's polar ice caps consist of water ice. Mars's polar caps, however, are a combination of water ice and carbon-dioxide ice.
The Martian polar caps thaw in summer and freeze in winter, showing that our solar system's planets are dynamic and changing.
Some of the moons in the outer solar system are completely covered in ice. They don't have just polar caps. They have ice shells.
Scientists think there is water beneath the moon's icy crust.
Earth's surface is covered mostly by water.
Some of our solar-system neighbors may have oceans, too, but they are hidden from view under layers of ice.
Beneath the icy crust of Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, lies a liquid ocean that may have more water than Earth contains.
Images of Europa's surface show ice that has broken up into ice flows, suggesting that water beneath the surface is moving and cracking the ice.
The ice on Europa is generally hundreds of miles thick.
If you really want a place that harbors life, then Earth is it. Our planet is neither too hot nor too cold. It has fierce storms and winds, but not at the extremes seen elsewhere in the solar system.
As scientists learn about our neighboring worlds, they realize how forbidding these places can be. They also document how wonderful our Earth is and how accommodating it is for life. Earth is our oasis in space.
Earth is our oasis in space.
Earth is our oasis.
Haumea is an oddly-shaped dwarf planet.
Haumea spins rapidly, turning once every four hours, and is believed to be composed mostly of rock with a thin, icy shell and a dark red spot.
Astronomers think a collision with a larger body caused the dwarf planet to lose its surface ice, producing the rapid spin.
Haumea is named for the Hawaiian goddess of fertility and childbirth. Haumea's moons are named for the goddess' two daughters.
Makemake was discovered in March and is classified as a dwarf planet. Its color is reddish-brown, and it has no atmosphere.
Pluto was the smallest planet until August 2006, when the International Astronomical Union reclassified it as a dwarf planet. It is the largest dwarf planet known.
Pluto is composed of a large rocky core wrapped in thick layers of ices.
Pluto's icy surface and extremely thin atmosphere are predominantly composed of nitrogen with small amounts of methane and carbon monoxide.
Pluto's terrain shows remarkable variation including dark/bright regions and smooth/mountainous areas.
Pluto's atmosphere is hazy and extended enough that it is continually being lost into space through interaction with the solar wind.
Pluto’s orbit is more elliptical and more inclined than the orbits of the eight solar system planets.
The key reason why Pluto is no longer considered a planet is that it is one among thousands to millions of other objects orbiting within the Kuiper Belt region. Also, the icy dwarf planet is not massive enough to clear debris from its orbit.
Callisto, the outermost of the four Galilean moons, has an old surface that is perhaps the most heavily cratered of any object in the solar system.
The largest object in the solar system is the sun. It contains percent of the mass of the solar system.
The sun is at the center of the solar system, and the planets, asteroids, moons, and comets orbit the sun.
The Earth is the third planet from the sun.
Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, and Earth is the fifth-largest.
Earth and Venus have a couple of things in common: they are rocky planets and are about the same size.
Venus is different in many ways from Earth. Venus has a harsh environment, is very hot, and has a poisonous atmosphere with acid clouds.
Mars is about half the size of Earth.
The planets are different sizes. From smallest to largest they are: Mercury, Mars, Venus, Earth, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn and Jupiter.
Jupiter is roughly times larger than Earth.
Venus and Earth are roughly the same size.
The sun is the closest star to Earth and provides us with most of our energy and light.
Earth turns on its axis once every day.
When we experience darkness, we are facing away from the sun. When we experience daylight, we are facing the sun.
We can't see other stars during the day because the sun's light illuminates Earth's atmosphere.
The sun is glowing, not burning like a fire.
The sun glows because its temperature is about 5,degrees Celsius.
The temperature of a wood fire is less than a thousand degrees Fahrenheit.
Nuclear fusion takes place deep in the sun's core at a temperature of about million degrees Celsius. As the heat travels out through the sun's layers, it becomes much cooler, but still hot enough to glow in visible light.
The inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) are closer together than the outer ones (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune).
The inner planets are closest to the sun. The outer planets are farthest away from the sun.
The planets in the inner solar system are tens of millions of kilometers apart; the planets in the outer solar system are hundreds of millions of kilometers apart.
Comets occasionally visit the inner solar system from their home in the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud.
Although comets and asteroids are both tiny objects that orbit in the solar system, their composition differs. Asteroids are mostly rock with some ice, while comets are mostly ice with some rock.
Comets do not always have tails. They develop a fuzzy, shell-like cloud called a coma, and one, two, or three tails when near the sun.
Comets have no coma or tail when far away from the sun.
Comets are part of the solar system. Scientists believe they come from one of two locations within the solar system: the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud.
The comets that we see often — every years — come from the Kuiper Belt.
The comets that we see rarely — every few thousand years — come from the Oort Cloud.
Meteors are the bright flashes of light seen in the night sky. They are caused by meteoroids — small, solid objects moving through space that have entered Earth's atmosphere.
Usually, meteoroids burn up in the atmosphere and never reach the ground. A meteorite is the chunk of material that does reach the ground.
A meteor is a bright streak of light in the sky caused when a meteoroid (a small chunk of rock or ice) enters the Earth's atmosphere and heats up.
Asteroids are not close to each other. They are roughly million miles from each other.
There is only one star, the sun, in the solar system.
Besides the sun, the solar system consists of planets, moons, asteroids, and comets.
The solar system resides in the Milky Way galaxy.
Many other stars are outside our solar system, but part of our Milky Way galaxy.
Galaxies contain from tens of millions to trillions of stars.
Scientists are sending out spacecraft and pointing telescopes to learn more about the solar system.
Among the many questions scientists are trying to answer are whether Mars has liquid water and how the solar system was formed.
The absolute brightness or magnitude of an object is the apparent brightness or magnitude it would have if it were located exactly parsecs away.
The apparent brightness of our Sun is much greater than that of the star Rigel in the constellation Orion because it is so close to us. However, if both objects were placed at the same distance from us, Rigel would appear much brighter than our Sun because its absolute brightness is much larger.

That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus.
For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings.
Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways, and his habits were regular.
Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with.
Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the city.
Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night.
On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.
As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life gradually deepened and increased.
His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer.
In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller.
His eyes were sharp and piercing.
His thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision.
His chin had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination.
His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.
The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself.
My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence.
His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge.
Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing.
My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System.
That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.
"You appear to be astonished," he said, smiling at my expression of surprise.
"You see," he explained, "I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones."
You say that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.
During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself.
One morning a young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more.
He could come at any moment.

Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bedroom. He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. "I have to use this room as a place of business," he said, "and these people are my clients."
It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet finished his breakfast.
The landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared.
All life is a great chain.
"What ineffable twaddle!" I cried, slapping the magazine down on the table; "I never read such rubbish in my life."
"What is it?" asked Sherlock Holmes.
I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world. I'm a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is.
Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private ones. When these fellows are at fault, they come to me, and I manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I am generally able, by the hold of my knowledge of the history of crime, to set them straight.
Lestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.
Lestrade is a well-known detective.
Do you have a printer?
They are all people who are in trouble about something, and want a little enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and then I pocket my fee.
"But do you mean to say," I said, "that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have seen every detail for themselves?" "Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way."
You remind me of Edgar Allen Poe's Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories.
"Have you read Gaboriau's works?" I asked. "Does Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective?" Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. "Lecoq was a miserable bungler," he said, in an angry voice; "he had only one thing to recommend him, and that was his energy. That book made me positively ill."
I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous.
No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done.
"I wonder what that fellow is looking for?" I asked, pointing to a stalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers.
"For Mr. Sherlock Holmes," he said, stepping into the room and handing my friend the letter.
My respect for his power of analysis increased wondrously.
"How in the world did you deduce that?" I asked.
"I have no time for trifles," he answered, brusquely.
He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of 'Enoch J. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.'
"Get your hat," he said. "You wish me to come?" "Yes, if you have nothing better to do."
A minute later we were both in a hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.
Tom and Mary played a board game with their friends.
It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the house-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets beneath.
My companion was in the best of spirits.
As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.
It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.
Stop, driver, stop!
We finished our journey upon foot.
A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street.
I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be further from his intention.
With an air of nonchalance which, under the circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line of railings.
There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil; but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it.
I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me.
At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced, flaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and wrung my companion's hand with effusion.
Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically.
"With two such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be much for a third party to find out," he said.
Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way.
"I think we have done all that can be done," he answered; "it's a queer case though, and I knew your taste for such things."
A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was blotched in places with mildew; and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.
Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble.
The solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.
A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him.
His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked, as though his death struggle had been a grievous one.
On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features.
I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark, grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London.
"There is no clue?" said Gregson. "None at all," chimed in Lestrade.
Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and kneeling down, examined it intently.
"You are sure that there is no wound?" he asked, pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round. "Positive!" cried both detectives.
Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual—presumably the murderer, if murder has been committed.
"It reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the year '34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?" "No, sir."
Tom and Mary played a game of Scrabble.
I've been looking for this for a long time.
Tom said Mary shouldn't tell John that she did that.
Do you think anyone would object if we did that?

As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon.
Finally, he sniffed the dead man's lips, and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots.
"You can take him to the mortuary now," he said. "There is nothing more to be learned."
"There's been a woman here," he cried. "It's a woman's wedding-ring."
There could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.
"This complicates matters," said Gregson. "Heaven knows, they were complicated enough before."
What did you find in his pockets?
It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to New York.
Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make some remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we were holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene, rubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.
I have just made a discovery of the highest importance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a careful examination of the walls.
The little man's eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his colleague.
He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.
"Look at that!" he said, triumphantly.
There was scrawled in blood-red letters a single word— RACHE.

A truth can only take effect when the recipient is ripe for it.
Why so?
It's all very well for you to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.
"I really beg your pardon!" said my companion, who had ruffled the little man's temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter.
So engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope.
He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore-leg.
"One other thing, Lestrade," he added, turning round at the door: "'Rache,' is the German for 'revenge'; so don't lose your time looking for Miss Rachel."
With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals open-mouthed behind him.
Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram.
"You amaze me, Holmes," said I. "Surely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave."
I have made a special study of cigar ashes—in fact, I have written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand either of cigar or of tobacco.
I cannot explain how this could happen.
"My head is in a whirl," I remarked; "the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows."
It was not done by a German. The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel.
I'm not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick.
You have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.
My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way in which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.
Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings.
We picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was engraved.
Holmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively. "We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips," he said.
"I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can," the constable answered, with his eyes upon the little golden disk.

I don't want anything to do with that.
I don't want to even look at it.
You're the one who brought it up.
"There's a half-sovereign for you," my companion said, standing up and taking his hat.
"The blundering fool!" Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our lodgings. "Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good luck, and not taking advantage of it."
There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it.
The fridge was empty.
The refrigerator was empty.
Tom came home for the summer.
Our morning's exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was tired out in the afternoon.
After Holmes' departure for the concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours' sleep.
My mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered man.
He was very late in returning—so late that I knew that the concert could not have detained him all the time.

I went to my bedroom and followed his advice.
Holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.
"The plot thickens," he said, as I entered.
Put your pistol in your pocket.
Don't frighten him by looking at him too hard.
"It is eight o'clock now," I said, glancing at my watch.
He will probably be here in a few minutes.
This is a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday—De Jure inter Gentes—published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642.
As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell.
"Does Dr. Watson live here?" asked a clear but rather harsh voice.
"Come in," I cried.
At my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment.
She appeared to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light.
After dropping a curtsey, she stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous, shaky fingers.
I glanced at my companion, and his face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to keep my countenance.
"Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer," I interrupted; "it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner."
"I'll follow her," he said, hurriedly; "she must be an accomplice, and will lead me to him."
Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly along the other side while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind.
"Either his whole theory is incorrect," I thought to myself, "or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery."
I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of Henri Murger's Vie de Bohème.
Ten o'clock passed, and I heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed.
It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of his latch-key.
The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not been successful.
"You don't mean to say," I cried, in amazement, "that that tottering, feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion, without either you or the driver seeing her?"
"Old woman be damned!" said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. "We were the old women to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an active one, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was inimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means of giving me the slip."
It shows that the man we are after is not as lonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risk something for him.
I left Holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the watches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his violin, and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he had set himself to unravel.
The papers next day were full of the "Brixton Mystery," as they termed it.
The Daily Telegraph remarked that in the history of crime there had seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German name of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister inscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political refugees and revolutionists.
After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England.
Aqua Tofana was a poison used in Naples and Rome in the 17th century.
The Marquise de Brinvilliers was accused of having conspired with her lover, the Chevalier de Sainte Croix, to poison her father and her two brothers in order to inherit their estates.
There were rumours that Brinvilliers had poisoned poor people during her visits to hospitals.
He only had one thing in mind.
She only had one thing in mind.
Tom only had one thing in mind.
They only had one thing in mind.
You should check the speed of your Internet connection.
The Vehmic courts were abolished in by order of Jérôme Bonaparte, king of Westphalia.
The Standard commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening of all authority.
It was the first time that Tom had ever been on a ferry.
Why can't you go to the police?
Tom tried to cover his tracks.
That would be counter-productive.
She was in a bad mood for the rest of the day.
Tom was in a bad mood for the rest of the day.
Tom's mom unplugged the TV just as he was about to beat the final boss.
Tom and Mary watched a scary movie together.
The deceased was an American gentleman who had been residing for some weeks in the Metropolis.
He was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary.
The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of catching the Liverpool express.
Tom spent all of his money at the arcades.
Tom needs to understand that this type of behavior is unacceptable.
We spoke on the phone last night.
His brother was the same way.
I think we should repaint this room.
We should paint the kitchen while we're at it.
Tom thanked his lucky stars.
Mary thanked her lucky stars.
English is the language of unlimited possibilities.
They were afterwards seen together upon the platform.
Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber's body was, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road, many miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are questions which are still involved in mystery.
It's heads I win and tails you lose.
"Have you found it, Wiggins?" "No, sir, we hain't," said one of the youths.
Here are your wages.
He handed each of them a shilling.
He waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats, and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.
"There's more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a dozen of the force," Holmes remarked.
The mere sight of an official-looking person seals men's lips. These youngsters, however, go everywhere and hear everything.
They are as sharp as needles.
Tom sounded very confident.
It is merely a matter of time.
There was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the fair-headed detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and burst into our sitting-room.
"My dear fellow," he cried, wringing Holmes' unresponsive hand, "congratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day."
A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion's expressive face.
"Do you mean that you are on the right track?" he asked.
"Take a seat, and try one of these cigars," he said.
Will you have some whiskey and water?
The tremendous exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain upon the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both brain-workers.
"You do me too much honour," said Holmes, gravely.
The detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently at his cigar.
Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement.
"The fun of it is," he cried, "that that fool Lestrade, who thinks himself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is after the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn."
The idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.
Of course, Doctor Watson, this is strictly between ourselves.
"You remember the hat beside the dead man?" "Yes," said Holmes; "by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road."
"I next called upon Madame Charpentier," continued the detective: "I found her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room too—an uncommonly fine girl she is too; she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. "
I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, when you come upon the right scent—a kind of thrill in your nerves.
'Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder Mr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?' I asked.
The daughter burst into tears.
I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter.
"At what o'clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?" I asked.
A terrible change came over the woman's face as I asked the question. Her features turned perfectly livid.
There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm, clear voice.
"No good can ever come of falsehood, mother," she said.
"God forgive you!" cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and sinking back in her chair. "You have murdered your brother."'
"Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth," the girl answered firmly.
"You had best tell me all about it now," I said.
Half confidences are worse than none.
I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised.
Have you ever tried speed dating?
He and his secretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent.
I noticed a "Copenhagen" label upon each of their trunks, showing that that had been their last stopping place.
He was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways.
Stangerson was a quiet, reserved man.
After twelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober.
His manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar.
My heart grew light when I saw him drive away.
My son is on leave just now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper is violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister.
When I closed the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind.
Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room.
What happened then I do not know.
I was too terrified to raise my head.
When I did look up, I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand.
"I don't think that fine fellow will trouble us again," he said.
With those words he took his hat and started off down the street.
The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber's mysterious death.
I saw that the whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way which I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her son returned.
When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, 'I suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel Drebber.'
My theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark.
The night was so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house.
As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent.
On his way home he met an old shipmate, and took a long walk with him.
On being asked where this old shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply.
I think the whole case fits together uncommonly well.
Why, by Jove, here's the very man himself!
It was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were talking, and who now entered the room.
The assurance and jauntiness which generally marked his demeanour and dress were however, wanting.
His face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged and untidy.
He stood in the centre of the room fumbling nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do.
"This is a most extraordinary case," he said at last—"a most incomprehensible affair."
"The secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson," said Lestrade gravely, "was murdered at Halliday's Private Hotel about six o'clock this morning."
The plot was predictable.
I stared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes.
"Stangerson too!" he muttered. "The plot thickens."
I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.
I was the first to discover what had occurred.
The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards.
I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats.
I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making inquiries entirely without avail.
From under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side.
He nearly fainted when he saw it.
She nearly fainted when she saw it.
The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it in.
The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress.
He was quite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold.
The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated the heart.
"And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man?" I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even before Sherlock Holmes answered. "The word RACHE, written in letters of blood," he said.
We were all silent for a while.
There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes.
My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle, tingled as I thought of it.
A milk boy, passing on his way to the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay there, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which was wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel.
The man was tall, had a reddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat.
We found blood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.
"Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer?" he asked.
Stangerson had Drebber's purse in his pocket, but it seems that this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd pounds in it, but nothing had been taken.
Whatever the motive of these extraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them.
There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man's pocket, except a single telegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the words, 'J. H. is in Europe.'
I thanked my lucky stars.
The man's novel, with which he had read himself to sleep, was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair beside him.
There was a glass of water on the table, and on the window-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.
Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight. "The last link," he cried, exultantly. "My case is complete."
The two detectives stared at him in amazement.
"I have now in my hands," my companion said, confidently, "all the threads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course details to be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts."
I went downstairs and carried the dog upstairs in my arms.
The dog's laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end. Indeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence.
Of the two pills in that box, one was of the most deadly poison, and the other was entirely harmless.
It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began to have a dim, vague perception of the truth.
"All this seems strange to you," continued Holmes, "because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence of it."
It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious, because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn.
This murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those outré and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.
Can you name the man who did it?
We all think that we're unique.
Humans are basically all the same.
We have both tried, and we have both failed.
"Any delay in arresting the assassin," I observed, "might give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity."
"There will be no more murders," he said at last, stopping abruptly and facing us. "You can put that consideration out of the question."
You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of laying our hands upon him.
I wonder who sent the flowers?
Mary received flowers from a secret admirer.
"Gentlemen," he cried, with flashing eyes, "let me introduce you to Mr. Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson."
The whole thing occurred in a moment—so quickly that I had no time to realize it.
I have a vivid recollection of that instant.
For a second or two we might have been a group of statues.
Then with an inarticulate roar of fury, the prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes' grasp, and hurled himself through the window.
So powerful and so fierce was he that the four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit.
In the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilization. From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence.
There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged cañons; and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are grey with saline alkali dust.
There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other hunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon the prairies.
The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.
In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco.
On the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks, with their rugged summits flecked with snow.
In this great stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life. There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull, grey earth—above all, there is absolute silence.
Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but silence—complete and heart-subduing silence.
It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali. Approach and examine them! They are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside.
An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty.
His face was lean and haggard, and his brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones.
His long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white.
His eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre.
The hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton.
As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support.
His clothes hung baggily over his shrivelled limbs.
The man was dying—dying from hunger and from thirst.
The great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might indicate the presence of moisture.
And then he realized that his wanderings had come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die.
And then he realized that his wanderings had come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. "Why not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence," he muttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.
The child was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion.
"Where's mother?" "Mother's gone; I guess you'll see her before long."

"Then mother's a deader too," cried the little girl, dropping her face in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.
I thought there was some chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together. It don't seem as though we've improved matters. There's an almighty small chance for us now!
"Do you mean that we are going to die too?" asked the child, checking her sobs, and raising her tear-stained face. "I guess that's about the size of it."
"Why didn't you say so before?" she said laughing gleefully. "You gave me such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we'll be with mother again."
I'll tell her how awful good you've been. I'll bet she meets us at the door of heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot of buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was fond of.
The man's eyes were fixed upon the northern horizon.
In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards, the vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.
"Say, did God make this country?" "Of course He did," said her companion, rather startled by this unexpected question. "He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri," the little girl continued. "I guess somebody else made the country in these parts. It's not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the trees."
Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her chubby face and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread Being with whom they were face to face, while the two voices—the one thin and clear, the other deep and harsh—united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness.
The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her protector.
He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the man's grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.
As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West.
Leave your horses below and we will await you here.
In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their horses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had excited their curiosity.
They advanced rapidly and noiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts.
The watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline.
On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man, long-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness.
His placid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep.
Beside him lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his brown sinewy neck; and her golden-haired head resting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic.
On the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of the new comers, uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away.
The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers, who stared about them in bewilderment.
Tom slept through his Chemistry exam.

Were you... raped?
Are you telling me that he raped you?
I want this woman out now.

Tom was hanged for a murder he did not commit.
I like to inquire into everything. Hercule Poirot is a good dog. The good dog follows the scent, and if, regrettably, there is no scent to follow, he noses around — seeking always something that is not very nice.
The impossible cannot have happened, therefore the impossible must be possible in spite of appearances.

Clowns are almost everywhere these days in popular culture.
Clowns are perhaps best known for performing in traveling circuses.
Clowns have been making crowds laugh for generations.
What clowns represent in popular culture has changed a lot over the past years.
Clowns have existed in different forms for a long time. Researchers have found evidence of clowns in ancient Rome, China, and Africa. Their job was to make the ancient rulers laugh.
At least one Native American group, the Hopi Tribe, also has a tradition involving clown-like characters.
Clowns began appearing in the form we recognize today in the 17th century, as a character known as a harlequin. They were common in European theater, and played a character who acted foolish or played tricks.
A harlequin wore colorful clothing and covered his face with a mask to protect his identity.
Clowns from Europe arrived in North America after England began exporting circuses, with their clowns, other performers and trained animals.
Starting in the early 1900s, circus shows were very successful in the United States.
In the 1950s and 1960s, the popularity of clowns grew because of television.
Bozo the Clown appeared in a number of TV programs for children.
In the 1960s, McDonald’s, the fast-food business, chose a happy clown to appear in its advertisements.
Today that company mascot, Ronald McDonald, is world famous.
McDonald’s says Ronald McDonald is keeping a low profile with reports of creepy clown sightings on the rise.
The image of a happy clown is largely an American creation. So says Benjamin Radford, who wrote a book called Bad Clowns. In other cultures, he says, the clown character is not necessarily good.
“It’s a mistake to ask, ‘When did clowns go bad,’ … because clowns were never really good. Clowns have always been ambiguous.
The clown character originally… is a trickster figure… you can’t easily categorize them.
Radford said that at first, clown shows were meant for adults, not children. In fact, clown characters were meant to be a critique of society or projections of the fears and concerns of everyday people.
In the 18th century, English actor Joseph Grimaldi became famous for playing a clown in theaters. Grimaldi himself was reported to be an alcoholic and suffered from depression.
The character made people laugh, but was sad and lonely when he left the theater.
Juggalos, as supporters of the rap group Insane Clown Posse are known, gather in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington during a rally, Saturday, Sept. 16, 2017, to protest and demand that the FBI rescind its classification of the juggalos as "loosely organized hybrid gang."
The idea of clowns frightening people started gaining strength in the United States during the 1970s, partly because of John Wayne Gacy.
In the 1980s, evil clowns began appearing in movies like Poltergeist and Killer Klowns from Outer Space.
Probably the most famous evil clown character is “the Joker” character from recent Batman films.
In the autumn of 2016, many Americans began developing real concerns about clowns.
For people who work as—or are training to be—clowns, the “bad clown” image does not make their job easier.
For most people who work as clowns, their job is to make people happy and laugh.
How often do you get a chance to really laugh or be silly and have fun?
As long as there are still children in the world, there will still be a future for clowns.
Many women like to wear high-heeled shoes.
They may look nice but high-heels can cause pain and are not good for your feet.
Sometimes we call the really high-heeled shoes that women wear "killer heels."
To be well-heeled means to be wealthy and well-to-do. Perhaps wearing nice shoes is where “well-heeled” comes from.
To kick up your heels means to have fun. Some word experts think this expression may have come from the world of horses. Others say it comes from the way you might use your feet when you are waiting for something.
To kick up your heels means to have fun.
After studying all month, the students were happy to finish their exams, kick up their heels and relax!
Hey, cool your heels! The party will still be there!
After horses ran a long race, their feet were hot. So the animals stood in water to cool their feet.
Limber pine is beginning to colonize areas of the Great Basin once dominated by bristlecones.
The bristlecone pine is the longest-living thing on Earth.
These trees, with their strangely shaped, wind-beaten limbs, can live up to 5,years.
Researchers say warmer weather is permitting a similar kind of tree, the limber pine, to take over good growing places from the ancient bristlecone. They say the tree is being crowded out of mountainous areas where it grows.
Scientists at the University of California, Davis, compared the competing species to two old men in a very slow race up a mountainside. This race between such slow-growing trees takes thousands of years.
The bristlecone pine is the oldest individually growing organism.
Bristlecone pines grow in high mountain forests in eastern California, Nevada and Utah.
The bristlecones grow well in limestone soil. Most trees do not grow well in such soil.
In the mountains, the bristlecones face high winds and extreme temperatures.
To survive long periods without water, parts of the trees die, including much of their outer bark. This makes the trees appear dead, except for small green pine needles.
Experts have named the oldest known bristlecone pine "Methuselah." It is somewhere in the White Mountains of California. But it is not marked in any special way, so that people do not try to damage it.
The limber pine is the bristlecone’s distant relative and competitor. It also can live a long time – up to 2,years. It is found at lower elevations, where temperatures are warmer.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says progress is being made in reducing deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs). But it says much more needs to be done to save the almost million people who die every year from preventable causes.
In a new report, the WHO noted that cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases, cancers and diabetes are the biggest killers of people. Every year, the report said, million adults die before they reach old age. It noted they often die in the most productive period of their lives, between the ages of and 70.
The WHO says tobacco use, the harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diets and lack of physical activity are some of the top reasons for premature death.
Douglas Bettcher is the WHO director for the prevention of non-communicable diseases. He says little progress is being made on cutting premature death from such diseases.
The window of opportunity to save lives is closing.
