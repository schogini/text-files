We assess with high confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in aimed at the U.S. presidential election, the consistent goals of which were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.
We further assess that Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign then focused on undermining her expected presidency.

In relating the circumstances which have led to my confinement within this refuge for the demented, I am aware that my present position will create a natural doubt of the authenticity of my narrative.
It is an unfortunate fact that the bulk of humanity is too limited in its mental vision to weigh with patience and intelligence those isolated phenomena, seen and felt only by a psychologically sensitive few, which lie outside its common experience.
Men of broader intellect know that there is no sharp distinction betwixt the real and the unreal.
The prosaic materialism of the majority condemns as madness the flashes of super-sight which penetrate the common veil of obvious empiricism.
I have dwelt ever in realms apart from the visible world; spending my youth and adolescence in ancient and little-known books, and in roaming the fields and groves of the region near my ancestral home.
Close by my home there lies a singular wooded hollow, in whose twilight deeps I spent most of my time; reading, thinking and dreaming.
Well did I come to know the presiding dryads of those trees, and often have I watched their wild dances in the struggling beams of waning moon—but of these things I must not now speak.
I will tell only of the lone tomb in the darkest of the hillside thickets; the deserted tomb of the Hydes, an old and exalted family whose last direct descendant had been laid within its black recesses many decades before my birth.
Of the midnight storm which destroyed this gloomy mansion, the older inhabitants of the region sometimes speak in hushed and uneasy voices.
It was in mid-summer, when the alchemy of Nature transmutes the sylvan landscape to one vivid and almost homogeneous mass of green; when the senses are well-nigh intoxicated with the surging seas of moist verdure and the subtly indefinable odours of the soil and the vegetation.
In such surroundings the mind loses its perspective; time and space become trivial and unreal, and echoes of a forgotten prehistoric past beat insistently upon the enthralled consciousness.
All day I had been wandering through the mystic groves of the hollow; thinking thoughts I need not discuss, and conversing with things I need not name.
When, upon forcing my way between two savage clumps of briers, I suddenly encountered the entrance of the vault, I had no knowledge of what I had discovered.
As I closed the door behind me and descended the dripping steps by the light of my lone candle, I seemed to know the way.
Here I would lie outstretched on the mossy ground, thinking strange thoughts and dreaming of strange dreams.
A favourite haunt of mine during the day was the ruined cellar of the mansion that had burned down.
At last came that which I had long feared.
The mansion, gone for a century, once more reared its stately height to the raptured vision; every window ablaze with the splendour of many candles.
Inside the hall were music, laughter, and wine on every hand.
Red tongues of flame and searing gusts of heat engulfed the house.
In my dreams I found a little of the beauty I had vainly sought in life, and wandered through old gardens and enchanted woods.
Once when the wind was soft and scented I heard the south calling, and sailed endlessly and languorously under strange stars.
Once when the gentle rain fell I glided in a barge down a sunless stream under the earth till I reached another world of purple twilight, iridescent arbours, and undying roses.
Once I walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves and ruins, and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines, and pierced by a little gate of bronze.
As I looked upon the little gate in the mighty wall, I felt that beyond it lay a dream-country from which, once it was entered, there would be no return.
High up, crowning the grassy summit of a swelling mound whose sides are wooded near the base with the gnarled trees of the primeval forest, stands the old chateau of my ancestors.

Our economy doesn't work as well or grow as fast when a few prosper at the expense of a growing middle class.
While the top one percent has amassed a bigger share of wealth and income, too many families, in inner cities and in rural counties, have been left behind.
Stark inequality is also corrosive to our democratic ideal.
The next wave of economic dislocations won't come from overseas. It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good, middle-class jobs obsolete.
If we don't create opportunity for all people, the disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come.
After my election, there was talk of a post-racial America. And such a vision, however well-intended, was never realistic.
Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.
I've lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10, or 20, or years ago, no matter what some folks say. You can see it not just in statistics, you see it in the attitudes of young Americans across the political spectrum.
Social attitudes oftentimes take generations to change.
If our democracy is to work in this increasingly diverse nation, then each one of us need to try to heed the advice of a great character in American fiction — Atticus Finch — who said: "You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view…until you climb into his skin and walk around in it."
Increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it's true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there.
Politics is a battle of ideas.
Without some common baseline of facts, without a willingness to admit new information, and concede that your opponent might be making a fair point, and that science and reason matter then we're going to keep talking past each other, and we'll make common ground and compromise impossible.
How can elected officials rage about deficits when we propose to spend money on preschool for kids, but not when we're cutting taxes for corporations?
As my mother used to tell me, reality has a way of catching up with you.
In just eight years, we've halved our dependence on foreign oil; we've doubled our renewable energy; we've led the world to an agreement that has the promise to save this planet.
Without bolder action, our children won't have time to debate the existence of climate change. They'll be busy dealing with its effects: more environmental disasters, more economic disruptions, waves of climate refugees seeking sanctuary.
We can and should argue about the best approach to solve the problem. But to simply deny the problem not only betrays future generations, it betrays the essential spirit of this country — the essential spirit of innovation and practical problem-solving that guided our Founders.
It's that spirit—a faith in reason, and enterprise, and the primacy of right over might—that allowed us to resist the lure of fascism and tyranny during the Great Depression; that allowed us to build a post-World War II order with other democracies, an order based not just on military power or national affiliations but built on principles—the rule of law, human rights, freedom of religion, and speech, and assembly, and an independent press.
Our democracy is threatened whenever we take it for granted. All of us, regardless of party, should be throwing ourselves into the task of rebuilding our democratic institutions.
When voting rates in America are some of the lowest among advanced democracies, we should be making it easier, not harder, to vote.
When trust in our institutions is low, we should reduce the corrosive influence of money in our politics, and insist on the principles of transparency and ethics in public service.
When Congress is dysfunctional, we should draw our congressional districts to encourage politicians to cater to common sense and not rigid extremes.
In his own farewell address, George Washington wrote that self-government is the underpinning of our safety, prosperity, and liberty, but "from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken…to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth."
It falls to each of us to be those anxious, jealous guardians of our democracy; to embrace the joyous task we've been given to continually try to improve this great nation of ours.
For all our outward differences, we, in fact, all share the same proud title, the most important office in a democracy: Citizen.
If you're disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself.
My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you.
May God continue to bless the United States of America.

Due to my health issues and business interests, I will not be able to make it.
A world in which one percent of humanity controls as much wealth as the other percent will never be stable.
Just as the child in a slum today can see the skyscraper nearby, technology now allows any person with a smartphone to see how the most privileged among us live and the contrast between their own lives and others.
A quarter century after the end of the Cold War, the world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before, and yet our societies are filled with uncertainty, and unease, and strife.
I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open markets and accountable governance, of democracy and human rights and international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century.
The integration of our global economy has made life better for billions of men, women and children. Over the last years, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been cut from nearly percent of humanity to under percent. That's unprecedented. And it's not an abstraction. It means children have enough to eat; mothers don’t die in childbirth.
The Internet can deliver the entirety of human knowledge to a young girl in a remote village on a single hand-held device.
In medicine and in manufacturing, in education and communications, we’re experiencing a transformation of how human beings live on a scale that recalls the revolutions in agriculture and industry. And as a result, a person born today is more likely to be healthy, to live longer, and to have access to opportunity than at any time in human history.
The collapse of colonialism and communism has allowed more people than ever before to live with the freedom to choose their leaders.
Despite the real and troubling areas where freedom appears in retreat, the fact remains that the number of democracies around the world has nearly doubled in the last years.
In remote corners of the world, citizens are demanding respect for the dignity of all people no matter their gender, or race, or religion, or disability, or sexual orientation, and those who deny others dignity are subject to public reproach.
Around the world, refugees flow across borders in flight from brutal conflict.
Financial disruptions continue to weigh upon our workers and entire communities.
Across vast swaths of the Middle East, basic security, basic order has broken down.
We see too many governments muzzling journalists, and quashing dissent, and censoring the flow of information.
Terrorist networks use social media to prey upon the minds of our youth, endangering open societies and spurring anger against innocent immigrants and Muslims.
An explosion of social media has given ordinary people more ways to express themselves, and has raised people’s expectations for those of us in power.
Our international order has been so successful that we take it as a given that great powers no longer fight world wars; that the end of the Cold War lifted the shadow of nuclear Armageddon; that the battlefields of Europe have been replaced by peaceful union; that China and India remain on a path of remarkable growth.
I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to summon the confidence to carry this progress forward and to make sure that we do not abandon those very things that have delivered this progress.
In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.
As too often, those trumpeting the benefits of globalization have ignored inequality within and among nations; have ignored the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities; have left international institutions ill-equipped, underfunded, under-resourced, in order to handle transnational challenges.
Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself.
So the answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration. Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared, and that the disruptions—economic, political, and cultural—that are caused by integration are squarely addressed.
It starts with making the global economy work better for all people and not just for those at the top.
While open markets, capitalism have raised standards of living around the globe, globalization combined with rapid progress and technology has also weakened the position of workers and their ability to secure a decent wage.
In advanced economies like my own, unions have been undermined, and many manufacturing jobs have disappeared.
Often, those who benefit most from globalization have used their political power to further undermine the position of workers.
In developing countries, labor organizations have often been suppressed, and the growth of the middle class has been held back by corruption and underinvestment.
Global capital is too often unaccountable—nearly $trillion stashed away in tax havens, a shadow banking system that grows beyond the reach of effective oversight.
We cannot unwind integration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box.
The stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the wasteland of North Korea shows that central, planned control of the economy is a dead end.
After the recession, the top one percent of Americans were capturing more than percent of income growth. But today, that's down to about half.
Last year, poverty in this country fell at the fastest rate in nearly years.
That’s why we’ve worked with other nations to create higher and clearer standards for banking and taxation -- because a society that asks less of oligarchs than ordinary citizens will rot from within.
That’s why we’ve pushed for transparency and cooperation in rooting out corruption, and tracking illicit dollars, because markets create more jobs when they're fueled by hard work, and not the capacity to extort a bribe.
For the small fraction of what we spent at war in Iraq we could support institutions so that fragile states don’t collapse in the first place, and invest in emerging economies that become markets for our goods.
I believe advanced economies still need to do more to close the gap between rich and poor nations around the globe.
It's not just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do.
And that’s why we need to follow through on our efforts to combat climate change. If we don't act boldly, the bill that could come due will be mass migrations, and cities submerged and nations displaced, and food supplies decimated, and conflicts born of despair.
There appears to be growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now.
I believe in a liberal political order -- an order built not just through elections and representative government, but also through respect for human rights and civil society, and independent judiciaries and the rule of law.
I know that some countries, which now recognize the power of free markets, still reject the model of free societies. And perhaps those of us who have been promoting democracy feel somewhat discouraged since the end of the Cold War, because we've learned that liberal democracy will not just wash across the globe in a single wave.
My belief that governments serve the individual, and not the other way around, is shaped by America’s story.
Yes, in America, there is too much money in politics; too much entrenched partisanship; too little participation by citizens, in part because of a patchwork of laws that makes it harder to vote.
Too often, in capitals, decision-makers have forgotten that democracy needs to be driven by civic engagement from the bottom up, not governance by experts from the top down.
We must reject any forms of fundamentalism, or racism, or a belief in ethnic superiority that makes our traditional identities irreconcilable with modernity. Instead we need to embrace the tolerance that results from respect of all human beings.
I do not believe progress is possible if our desire to preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate another group. If our religion leads us to persecute those of another faith, if we jail or beat people who are gay, if our traditions lead us to prevent girls from going to school, if we discriminate on the basis of race or tribe or ethnicity, then the fragile bonds of civilization will fray.
As President of the United States, I know that for most of human history, power has not been unipolar. The end of the Cold War may have led too many to forget this truth.
I’ve noticed as President that at times, both America’s adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington -- and perhaps too many in Washington believed that as well.
I believe America has been a rare superpower in human history insofar as it has been willing to think beyond narrow self-interest; that while we’ve made our share of mistakes over these last years -- and I’ve acknowledged some -- we have strived, sometimes at great sacrifice, to align better our actions with our ideals. And as a consequence, I believe we have been a force for good.
We cannot escape the prospect of nuclear war unless we all commit to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and pursuing a world without them.
We can't combat a disease like Zika that recognizes no borders -- mosquitos don't respect walls -- unless we make permanent the same urgency that we brought to bear against Ebola -- by strengthening our own systems of public health, by investing in cures and rolling back the root causes of disease, and helping poorer countries develop a public health infrastructure.
We can only eliminate extreme poverty if the sustainable development goals that we have set are more than words on paper.
Human ingenuity now gives us the capacity to feed the hungry and give all of our children -- including our girls -- the education that is the foundation for opportunity in our world. But we have to put our money where our mouths are.
Sometimes I'm criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced that in the long run, giving up some freedom of action -- not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to international rules over the long term -- enhances our security. And I think that's not just true for us.
Together, we established an Open Government Partnership so that, increasingly, transparency empowers more and more people around the globe.
And together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home.
We have to imagine what it would be like for our family, for our children, if the unspeakable happened to us.
We still have a lot to discuss.

There's a much darker and more cynical view of history that we can adopt. Human beings are too often motivated by greed and by power. Big countries for most of history have pushed smaller ones around. Tribes and ethnic groups and nation states have very often found it most convenient to define themselves by what they hate and not just those ideas that bind them together.
Time and again, human beings have believed that they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment only to repeat, then, cycles of conflict and suffering. Perhaps that's our fate.
We have to remember that the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war. But we also have to remember that the choices of individual human beings created a United Nations, so that a war like that would never happen again.
Each of us as leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best. For we have shown that we can choose a better history.
Sitting in a prison cell, a young Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote that, "Human progress never rolls on the wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God."
During the course of these eight years, as I've traveled to many of your nations, I have seen that spirit in our young people, who are more educated and more tolerant, and more inclusive and more diverse, and more creative than our generation; who are more empathetic and compassionate towards their fellow human beings than previous generations.
My own family is made up of the flesh and blood and traditions and cultures and faiths from a lot of different parts of the world -- just as America has been built by immigrants from every shore.
And in my own life, in this country, and as President, I have learned that our identities do not have to be defined by putting someone else down, but can be enhanced by lifting somebody else up. They don’t have to be defined in opposition to others, but rather by a belief in liberty and equality and justice and fairness.
This is what I believe: that all of us can be co-workers with God. And our leadership, and our governments, and this United Nations should reflect this irreducible truth.

The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.
Strange is our situation here upon earth. Each of us comes for a short visit, not knowing why, yet sometimes seeming to divine a purpose.
From the standpoint of daily life, however, there is one thing we do know: that man is here for the sake of other men —above all for those upon whose smile and well-being our own happiness depends, and also for the countless unknown souls with whose fate we are connected by a bond of sympathy.
Schopenhauer’s saying— “A man can surely do what he wills to do, but he cannot determine what he wills”—impressed itself upon me in youth and has always consoled me when I have witnessed or suffered life’s hardships.
To ponder interminably over the reason for one’s own existence or the meaning of life in general seems to me, from an objective point of view, to be sheer folly.
I have never belonged wholeheartedly to country or state, to my circle of friends, or even to my own family. These ties have always been accompanied by a vague aloofness, and the wish to withdraw into myself increases with the years.
My political ideal is democracy. Everyone should be respected as an individual, but no one idolized. It is an irony of fate that I should have been showered with so much uncalled for and unmerited admiration and esteem. Perhaps this adulation springs from the unfulfilled wish of the multitude to comprehend the few ideas which I, with my weak powers, have advanced.
To know that what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their most primitive forms— this knowledge, this feeling, is at the center of true religiousness. In this sense, and in this sense only, I belong in the ranks of devoutly religious men.
I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own—a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty.
It is enough for me to contemplate the mystery of conscious life perpetuating itself through all eternity, to reflect upon the marvelous structure of the universe which we can dimly perceive, and to try humbly to comprehend even an infinitesimal part of the intelligence manifested in nature.

Human rights is the soul of our foreign policy.

War may sometimes be a necessary evil. But no matter how necessary, it is always an evil, never a good. We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other's children.
Without truth, without trust, America cannot flourish. Trust is at the very heart of our democracy, the sacred covenant between a president and the people. When that trust is violated, the bonds that hold our republic together begin to weaken.

Are you sure you don't want to try this?

I'll send you her picture.

I’m President of the United States and I’m not going to eat any more broccoli.
We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a new world order, a world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations.
When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chance at this new world order, an order in which a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the U.N.'s founders.
We have in this past year made great progress in ending the long era of conflict and cold war.
Think about every problem, every challenge, we face. The solution to each starts with education.
Trying to eliminate Saddam, extending the ground war into an occupation of Iraq, would have violated our guideline about not changing objectives in midstream, engaging in "mission creep", and would have incurred incalculable human and political costs.
No nation can fully understand itself or find its place in the world if it does not look with clear eyes at all the glories and disgraces, too, of the past. We, in the United States, acknowledge such an injustice in our own history: The internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry was a great injustice, and it will never be repeated.
We live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make it better.
The totalitarian era is passing, its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient, lifeless tree.
A new breeze is blowing, and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on.
There are times when the future seems thick as a fog; you sit and wait, hoping the mists will lift and reveal the right path. But this is a time when the future seems a door you can walk right through into a room called tomorrow.
We know what works: Freedom works. We know what's right: Freedom is right.
I do not mistrust the future; I do not fear what is ahead. For our problems are large, but our heart is larger. Our challenges are great, but our will is greater. And if our flaws are endless, God's love is truly boundless.
There's a letter for you.
Tom is away on a ski trip for the weekend.
Tom scalded his arm.
I scalded myself with boiling water from the kettle.
Tom was obviously impressed.
He was obviously impressed.
She was obviously impressed.
I should pay more attention.
Let's get takeout.
Tom and Mary are studying together in the library.
Do you want to come over to my place and watch a movie or something?
I wore my favorite dress.
I like her and she likes me.
I like him and he likes me.
The punishment must fit the crime.
I can't stand my roommate.
The tax code is too complex.
We have not come this far without a struggle and I assure you we cannot go further without a struggle.
For twelve years this Nation was afflicted with hear-nothing, see-nothing, do-nothing Government. The Nation looked to Government but the Government looked away.
When they realized that she was breathing normally, they took her off the danger list.
Maybe you can find the replacement parts you need in a salvage yard.
We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace—business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering. They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs. We know now that Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob.
Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me—and I welcome their hatred.
The peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country.
Through much of the last century, America’s faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea. Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations.
That poodle has an immaculate pedigree, with illustrious ancestors on both sides stretching back generations.
The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth.
And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent, but not a country.
This is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.
Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because, in a time of peace, the stakes of our debates appear small. But the stakes for America are never small.
The judiciary should not become merely an extension of the legislative branch.
America, at its best, is compassionate. In the quiet of American conscience, we know that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation’s promise.
Where there is suffering, there is duty. Americans in need are not strangers, they are citizens, not problems, but priorities. And all of us are diminished when any are hopeless.
I can only hypothesize that he came here for the necklace.
Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty, but we can listen to those who do. And I can pledge our nation to a goal: When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the other side.
Americans are generous and strong and decent, not because we believe in ourselves, but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves. When this spirit of citizenship is missing, no government program can replace it. When this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.
We must confront the scandal of illiteracy in America, seen most clearly in high-poverty schools, where nearly percent of fourth graders are unable to read at a basic level.
We must address the low standing of America test scores amongst industrialized nations in math and science.
When we see social needs in America, my administration will look first to faith-based programs and community groups, which have proven their power to save and change lives.
Many people are struggling to keep a roof over their heads.
I plan to go skiing next weekend.

Don't give him any of that soup.
Go home immediately.
I feel itchy.
I'm looking after Jim.
I'm so itchy.

Tom is inquisitive by nature.
I have no idea how I hurt my foot.
It's very unusual for Tom to be here this time of day.
I should have paid more attention.
I should have paid more attention to her feelings.
I should have paid more attention in class.
I should have paid more attention to the papers I signed.
I should have paid more attention to Mary.
You can't land there.
Put that bag down.
What's going on this time?
Stay outside the field.
Helicopters are noisy.
I should have studied harder.
The helicopter was flying around the field.
Check the temperature.
Did you see that, Jamal?
What if I don't pass?

Keep it straight.
Keep the rope stretched tight.

Thanks for speaking up for me.
I'd like to explain some things for you.

Jamal, you try.
Why do we need to learn this?
Why don't you take a break, Jim?
He wants to play next.
You've beaten me six times.
Why do I need to learn this stuff?
You've already beaten me six times.
Why do we need to learn this stuff anyway?
Look at all the damage you've done.
It's time to put an end to this.
I'm stopping.
I promise not to touch my bicycle for a whole month.
I have to do something, guys.
We're under attack, guys!
Why do you always have to learn things the hard way?
We sit and wait.
You made a promise, Jamal.
Why do I have to know this stuff?
Why do I have to learn all this stuff?
You said you won't touch beer for a month.
You're our hero.
Your son is a hero.
Why do I have to learn this stuff? I'm never going to need to use it anyway.
I'm glad that you kept your promise.
It's your turn, Jim.
I'll talk to him about the loud music.
What is that across the street?
I'm the doctor.
Your patients won't abandon you.
If she wants a war, she's got a war.
You don't have that, right?
It didn't work out, did it?
There are no medical workers there at all.
Why don't you just stay here and I leave?
Did he fall for it?
Wait. Come back.
A part of my Lisa stays with me.
It sure is gonna be nice to do that.
Sorry, it doesn't fit.
I knew I would find you.
Maybe some people just aren't meant to be together.
Why do we learn so much useless stuff in school?
I think you can keep it.
I'll show you how to properly use it.
I think we can find the way back by ourselves.
Hey! Where is everybody?
Just go and get some rest.
Come back here, man!
It's so bad.
How do you guys know?
His name is Fadil the rascal.
He's famous for giving teachers a hard time.
He's not here today.
You can't stick your head out of the window. It's dangerous.
Wait. It's happening all over again.
Would it work?
Can you show me another magic trick?
Can you show it to me tomorrow?
Can you show me your new car?
"I'm Jamal. Nice to meet you." "I'm Sarah."
Hey, Jim!
Wait. I can erase it.
It's much better on a big screen.
We're here, Jamal.
When are we going to ever use this stuff?

Is he in trouble again?
Tom has a flip phone.
Can you tell me how this happened?

He's not here tonight.
Is he moving away forever?
Are you talking about Jenny?
I should have kept up with my assignments.

If you miss this flight, you'd never get to see Dad.

Why is Tom singing that song we asked him not to sing?
I just hope no one saw me dancing.
Tom is busy writing a letter.
I'm really gonna miss you.
I just recently lost my wife, too.
Don't you think we should let Tom do whatever he wants?

Can you take Jim to the airport?
I hope Tom isn't the only one who knows how to do that.
I want to learn to play the flute.

I wonder what's going on here.
What's going on, Sarah?
They should be here soon.
We're coming to the rescue.
I'm just doing my job, Jim.
He knows me already.
Since he knows me already, I'll introduce you to him.
Is that so weird?
They were excited to meet Jamal.
That must be Jamal.
You're Jim, right?
Wait. I wanna talk to you.
He doesn't even want to speak to me.
Nice work, Jim.
That must be Jenny.
Let's call him now.
Excuse me. How do you know my name?
You must be Jim's friends.
Would you like to play with us, Jim?
I'm sorry guys. Maybe next time.
Jim is so dirty.
You're Tom, right?
I'm so tired today.
I'm Jim's friend, Tom.
Hey! Wait!
What's wrong with you, guys?
Jim ignored all of us.
"It's nothing." "It's not nothing."
He thinks he's too good for us.
There he is. Do you see him?
I can't sing this song in that key.
I could force you to help Tom, but I don't really want to.
I did some shopping on my way home.

I can't hear you very well. Can you speak up?
Did you hear Layla call your name?
I knew it, Jim! I knew it!
It's a shame, because I really wanted to play.
I yelled at him by mistake and I felt really bad.
They think you did all that stuff on purpose.
I've always been alone.
You don't want to go through so much trouble fo me, do you?
What? No way!
He does think he's too good for us.
OK guys. I'm going to bed now.
I wonder what I should do now.
Clear the road. It's not safe.
There is a huge fire up there.
We have a problem. There are kids inside that building.

Jim has made many new friends.
It must have been a prank call.
Well Jim, we're on our way now.
I haven't seen any bears around here.
They said they have been having a very hard time with prank calls.
Leave it to me, guys.
Could you tell me what happened?
It's always the same voice.
That's enough for me, guys.
You can count on me, Jim.
That's why you need a detective to figure it out.
Please don't mind him.
Why did you let Jim go?
Cops can't question him because of that.
You did it, didn't you?
Alright. I give up.
Is that a fire truck?
Are you talking to me, man?
Hey, sist!
I've been looking for you all over.

Tom didn't even say hi.
I wouldn't be allowed to do that even if I wanted to.
Tom says that's wrong.
I don't know what made me think I would enjoy it here.
Tom said Mary is busy.
I don't think I'm the only one here who speaks French.
Tom rejected my offer.
I wish you wouldn't sing those kinds of songs anymore.
Tom needs a job to do.
I'll have the same as usual.
"What'll you have?" "The same as usual."
I got up this morning at the same time I usually do.
Let's meet tomorrow at the same place we did last week.
Tom wasn't the one who paid the bill.
Light pollution prevents a third of the people on Earth from seeing the Milky Way.
Mary has a crush on you.
I've had a crush on you since I first saw you.
She's a troublemaker.
Just learn to swallow your pride.
I can drive to Boston and back on one tank of gasoline.
Tom might be busy now.
I would've bought more clothes if I had had the money.
Tom is unable to walk.
I may not be able to sing tonight. I have a sore throat.
Tom is always singing.
I've always wanted to learn how to sing classical music.
Tom dropped his phone.
I'm supposed to sing at least one country song every night.
Tom dove off the pier.
Your mental health is more important than your grades.
Tom vacuumed the carpet.
Mary cleaned her apartment from top to bottom.
Tom's house is tidy.
I can't believe you really want to live here all by yourself.
Tom can't do that yet.
I hope you have a chance to spend time with your family soon.
Tom rarely does that.
I'm supposed to stay after school and help clean the classroom.
Tom likes Mary a lot.
I've already told my parents that I want a flute for my birthday.
Tom went home early.
I wasn't able to sing very well tonight because I had a sore throat.
Tom has deceived us.
I think parents should sing with their children more often than most parents do.
Tom always wins.
My house is a mess.
My apartment is a mess.
My life is a mess.
Light pollution prevents a third of the world's population from seeing the Milky Way.
Light pollution prevents a third of humanity from seeing the Milky Way.
Light pollution prevents percent of people in North America from seeing the Milky Way.
We both work full time.
Stop interrupting me!
I will never forget this moment.
Young children are incapable of abstract thinking.
I need to drop off the kids at school.
Our house is very small.
Mary is folding the laundry.
There were toys scattered all over the floor.
Not everyone needs a college degree.
Tom completed an apprenticeship.
There were stacks of books all over the floor.
Tom insulted me.
I got laid off.
It was clear that Tom didn't want to leave.
How mad are you?
Tom doesn't care for ice cream.
You don't really plan to go outside on a cold day like today, do you?
How do you know you wouldn't have done the same thing Tom did if you were in his shoes?
How can I have a good time when everybody keeps complaining to me about things?
Tom has white hair.
I hate singing.
Tom leaves his clothes all over the house.
Tom leaves his dirty clothes lying all over the house.
I'm a terrible housekeeper.
How young is too young?
Some people think that the voting age should be lowered to 16.
Some countries make voting compulsory.
I've never heard Tom sing in public before.
How could it work?
Tom doesn't deserve any praise.
We both know what'll happen if we don't do what we're supposed to do.
Tom didn't seem to have any trouble convincing Mary to go out with him.
How confident are you that they'll get these repairs completed by Monday?
Tom is now retired.
I'm a Canadian.
I wouldn't let Tom do what he wanted to do.
How will you help?
Tom does not read books.
Tom doesn't read books.
Tom doesn't know why he's here.
We sat around the campfire, roasting marshmallows and singing songs.
I'm glad I wasn't the one who had to tell Tom that his wife had been killed.
How could you fall asleep when you were supposed to be watching the kids?
Tom sang a lullaby.
I really must go.
I wish we could go to Boston and visit Tom.
How smart are they?
Tom doesn't need too much help.
We checked into our hotel and then went out to do some sightseeing.
How old is too old?
How expensive is too expensive?
How fat is too fat?
How salty is too salty?
I don't think it's just me.
Tom is a pragmatist.
Starting a business is hard.
Tom forgot the words to the second verse, so he sang the first verse again.
How many people do you know who actually spend time with their children?
Tom asked questions.
I won't eat that.
I think Tom was supposed to be here by now.
How will I do that?
Tom drinks too much these days.
You know me well enough to know I wouldn't do something like that.
I didn't know that Tom was the one who taught you how to play the ukulele.
How long do you think it's going to take you to come up with a solution?
Tom has many things.
I'm still in bed.
I knew you wouldn't like the way Tom cooks.
How bad will it get?
Tom earns a living as a writer.
What does it usually cost to go to a professional basketball game?
I know that eventually I'm going to have to tell Tom about what happened.
How much does it usually cost to go to a professional basketball game?
Tom may not do that.
I can't sing well.
Electric cars will change the world.
In the future, everyone will drive an electric car.
Why do men's and women's clothes have buttons on opposite sides?
The broth is hot.
Has it ever happened before?
I don't think Tom will know how to do that.
How nervous are you?
Tom fell asleep on my shoulder.
My father would never allow me to go out with someone like you.
I still don't understand why Tom would want to do something like that.
How long do you think the jury will take before they reach a verdict?
Tom was pretty late.
I think it's safe.
How long do you think Tom has been waiting?
How do we pay for it?
I had a lot of fun working on this project.
Germany is about the same size as Japan.
Germany is about half the size of Texas.
Texas is almost twice the size of Germany.
Ontario is more than times the size of Germany.
This house has a clay tile roof.
This house has solar panels.
Tom fell asleep under the tree.
Don't you want to know why I didn't do what you asked me to do?
I don't think Tom is the kind of guy who would do that kind of thing.
How can I finish my homework when I have to help you clean the house?
How will Tom do that?
I wasn't impressed.
How do you know Tom isn't going to do that?
How romantic are you?
Tom fell when the ladder broke.
You should be able to do that without anyone's help, I think.
We don't see him very often.
Tom now has enough money to buy the guitar he's been wanting to buy.
How much money will we have to spend to have someone do that for us?
Tom gave Mary a ring.
I'm broke right now.
How did you know where Tom went to college?
How sad and pathetic!
Tom felt it was his duty to go.
We hope that you'll be able to do everything you want to do.
Tom didn't have enough time to do everything that needed to be done.
How do you think climate change will affect our lives in the future?
We don't see Tom very often.
We don't see Tom as often as we used to.
We don't see Tom much anymore.
By doing this, I'm feeling stronger, more accomplished and braver.
I'm proud of myself. Yes, I'm proud.
You're not to lecture me.
You're not to lecture me about what I should do and what I shouldn't do.
Instead of lecturing people, you should deal with your own damn problems.
He always thinks that he knows better.
I hate dismissive people.
He really thinks that he has some kind of superior knowledge.
He takes every opportunity to belittle you.
He would always imply that what others are saying isn't valid.
Don't you know that you're being dismissive?
Sex doesn't really matter to most Chinese.
He enjoys putting people down.
Winston hated capitalism, because he could never afford a house.
Winston doesn't want to buy a book, because he already has many boxes full of books.
Winston doesn't want to believe in any religion.
I'm willing to wait.
How did Tom know you were going to do that?
How's life in Boston?
Tom figured it was worth a try.
My parents wouldn't allow me to do that when I was your age.
How would you like it if I punched you the same way you punched Tom?
How long do you think it'll take you to finish writing this report?
Tom was very serious.
I hope I can do that.
Where did Tom learn how to sing like that?
How's your golf game?
Tom filled the box with apples.
Don't you ever get bored singing the same songs every night?
I see no reason why you shouldn't ask Tom to go to Boston with you.
How do I know that you're not just telling me what I want to hear?
Why is Tom resigning?
I value your opinion.
What's the real reason you don't like Tom?
How are your children?
Tom filled the cup to the brim.
Did you have to wear a uniform when you were in high school?
Tom didn't have enough time to do everything that he wanted to do.
How would you feel if someone said something like that about you?
How could Tom do this?
I was probably wrong.
We're going to have to ask Tom to help us.
How great is the risk?
Tom finished third in the race.
It's going to be difficult for us to get this done by 2:30.
I'd really like to know why Tom didn't do what we asked him to do.
How would you feel if my father said we couldn't go out together?
How did Tom apologize?
I intend to stay here.
We waited all afternoon for Tom to arrive.
How many are too many?
Tom found a job that he can do.
It was a lot of fun singing for the kids at the orphanage.
I think it'd be better if you didn't go drinking with Tom tonight.
How much more money do we need to spend to complete this project?
Tom seems to enjoy putting people down.
I'm tired of your diarrheal logorrhoea.
Tom seems to enjoy insulting people.
You'll never know the truth about me.
Tom eats a lot of chocolate.
Tom's mother told him that he shouldn't eat so much chocolate.
He didn't show any remorse for his actions.
Can I put forth a question?
I cried when Tom left.
I like riding my bike.
Tom told Mary that she should work harder.
How tough is your job?
Tom found a way to get it done.
Do you think you could handle that kind of responsibility?
I don't think Tom will be able to do what you're asking him to do.
How many years did it take you before you were fluent in French?
I know we'll find Tom.
I want you to do that.
Well, let's see! And then, what next?
Jamal is always so nice to me.
They're planning to visit the city late this afternoon.
I'm feeling a little sick.
My engine is out.
What can I do now?
The train must be coming.
What's this noise? Is it a train?
Hold this, please.
There he comes.
Why are you being towed by a bus?
The brave man over there saved my life.
I think that he's the world's most courageous fire fighter.
I'm proud to have you as my friend.
Are you Jamal Sadiq? I'm a big fan!
I have someone special to introduce you, too.
Jamal isn't just an ordinary man anymore.
I'm looking forward to working with you, Jamal.
I'm a famous person now.
Are we famous now?
I can't believe it. It's Fadil.
You sound tired today.
Oh, my back.
Could you hurry it back? I'm a bit busy.
Let's go, Jamal.
Oh, he left.
I missed my stop.
I shouldn't be doing this all the time.
Jamal, what are you doing here?
I'm here to give you a special offer.
You'll be staying with me at a luxurious logde.
We'll be having a press conference tomorrow morning, so get ready for your big speech.
It must be disappointing to leave.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance for Jamal.
It is a great opportunity, but I don't want to leave my friends.
Let's go to the car wash.
What should I do, Jamal?
Why are you up so late?
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.
It's not my working hour.
My mom must be worried.
Could you give me a ride home?
"Are you sick?" "No. Why are you asking that?"
Jamal gives me a ride every day.
Tom must be worried.
"I should thank you." "What for?"
I'm sure Tom must be worried.
Can we start if you're ready?
We'll start the press conference.
How do you feel about that now?
I would like to thank Fadil for offering me such a great chance.
That's where I wanna be.
That's where I wanna live.
He must have said it by accident.
That's where I want to live.
That's where I want to be.
This is a great chance for you.
I've already made up my mind, Jamal.
Thank you for staying.
We can begin if you're ready.
We can start if you're ready.
I'm so happy that you're staying.
I'll count on you like always.
I think it's better for Fadil to stay here.
I'm happy so long as he's happy.
It's been a busy day today.
Do you wanna come with me?
I'm a little tired, actually.
Sorry. I didn't know you were here.
I think it would be better if Tom stayed here with us.
So who's this guy?
Tom told Mary that she should lose weight.
How would you do this?
Tom gave me a penetrating gaze.
It's been three years since I graduated from high school.
Tom thought it wouldn't be safe for Mary to walk home by herself.
How long do you think you'll need to finish writing this report?
Tom came here by taxi.
I wish we'd done that.
Tom says he'll never sing in public again.
How busy are you today?
This is my friend, Jamal.
Come to play with me.
Let's play tag together.
Stop right there, I said.
Why isn't Jamal playing with us?
This game seems a bit dangerous.
I'm gonna show you something funny. Watch.
This game is so noisy.
Come outside and play with us.
I need to go to school fast.
Let me on.
I told you how to do it.
Tom gave me your email address.
Do you think you should be doing that without permission?
I thought I told you I didn't want you to talk to Tom about that.
Let's go to school for now.
How can I make sure that this won't happen to me or my parents?
Tom died from cholera.
I won't do this again.
Tom probably thought I wouldn't like this.
How can we help people?
Tom got a chance to start over.
We have a lot of equipment that no one knows how to use.
My towing rack is broken.
There are many different buildings in our town.
What's that place?
You have to be quiet in class.
Do you recognize this place?
That's right. You know very well?
What's that funny sound?
Did you just fart?
That's all Jamal's fault.
See you after class.
My back door needs to be fixed.
He's at the playground with his friends.
He wants to go to the playground.
Let's do it again, guys.
I think it would be a good idea for you to go to Boston with Tom.
How do you know it's a bad movie if you've never even seen it?
Tom died of emphysema.
I'm going home to bed.
Tom needs to do what Mary asked him to do.
How dangerous was that?
Tom got married three days ago.
This next song is one that people always ask me to sing.
I didn't know that Tom was the one who was going to sing tonight.
How would you feel if someone hacked into your email account?
You keep telling me that I can't do anything.
Let's go to the garage and see if Jamal is there.
He will continue to cry if we stay here.
Do you wanna go see them by yourself?
Let's get out of this playground.
Jamal feels a little better.
I know this place.
I'll show you. Watch.
Let's go to the garage and see if Tom is there.
Let's go visit Tom.
Let's go visit Tom in Boston.
Let's go see if Tom is at home.
We went to Tom's house to talk to him, but he wasn't at home.
Tom is likely to do that.
I'm not ready to stop.
Tom may not have done what he said he did.
How did you get so fat?
Tom got out of jail in October.
It'll be difficult for me to sing this song in that key.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary used to be married to each other.
How much fuel does a Boeing carry for a nine-hour flight?
Tom swam with his son.
I'm really scared now.
So where's the fire?
We have had so much fun.
I wanna be a smart man like Jamal when I grow up.
The electric car suddenly ran out of energy.
I know a filling station not very far from here.
My engine is gonna go off soon.
OK. Just a little more.
We safely arrived at the hospital.
You do seem very close.
You're very good together.
Have you finished filling?
Jamal came back in the evening.
Can you come down slowly?
I can move freely now.
You must be so tired.
I know it must be hard.
Jamal has to go home now.
You're wasting your time with me.
Aren't you tired from taking care of him all day?
Why did they become so close?
I had so much fun.
I had a lot of fun, too.
Our bond of friendship is stronger for ever.
Stop right now!
Didn't I tell you it's dangerous to speed on the road?
This is the last time I let you go.
You're stopping on the stop line.
You have to follow the rules for your own safety.
It might seem like a minor rule, but you have to keep to it next time.
You shouldn't let him go that easily.
Am I right this time?
You must pay attention to the road when you're driving.
Stop the bus exactly at the station.
Let's go and play with the ball.
Don't you know it's dangerous to play with a ball by the roadside?
You must have been scared.
You really didn't have to be so hard on the kids.
You could still do that in a nicer way.
I didn't do anything wrong, man.
I wish Fadil could be a little more nice.
It'd be good if you came alone?
So what was that about?
How do you feel about acting a little nicer?
Are you behaving yourselves today?
You can go now, I guess.
Fadil seems to be in a good mood today.
Tom may not do what we've asked him to do.
How tough was the test?
Tom got to school just in time.
Is there anything else you would like me to buy for you?
Tom couldn't have finished writing the report without your help.
How long has it been since you've slept in a comfortable bed?
We can't let Tom sing.
I've run out of ideas.
Tom agreed to take the job we offered him.
How come you don't sing?
Something was tickling me all of a sudden.
I stopped behind the stop line correctly this time.
Tom had dinner with the others.
Do you think you can write that report without any help?
How can anyone trust anything Tom says? He's a pathological liar.
How were you able to stay so calm in such a scary situation?
I couldn't go anywhere.
It's because of me that Tom is doing that.
How did it go yesterday?
Tom had his left leg amputated.
You go first, Jamal.
We'll go first.
Jamal kept bursting out with laughter.
Fadil seems to be in a really good mood.
Maybe we should go to the repair shop.
Are you lost by any chance?
I'll take you to the kindergarten.
I don't wanna get on.
You're making me laugh.
How did you know that Tom was the one who made these sandwiches?
How much do you pay each year for your children's education?
Tom may have done that.
I have to do that soon.
It wasn't easy to convince Tom to help us.
How did the fight begin?
Tom had to do different things.
You didn't have to sing with us if you didn't want to.
How long do you think Tom and Mary have been seeing each other?
How could anyone in their right mind do something like that?
See? It isn't scary, right?
Jamal is here.
That's our job. That's what we're here for.
What's tickling me?
I have to go to the repair shop tomorrow.
You seem to be in a good mood today.
Fadil seems to be in a really good mood today.
It must be hard for you, I know.
Jamal brought his car to the repair shop to have it checked.
I wonder what's wrong, Jamal.
It tickles.
Take a look at these feathers.
No one is gonna take me seriously now.
Go out on the road and you'll see.
Everybody seems to like Jamal.
Doesn't the city seem safer now?
Can you actually come with Jamal?
What was the call about?
There will be a safety lesson at the kindergarten.
They were playing together at the playground.
We've really had a good match.
Where is he rushing to?
I'm already late for school.
They just went past us.
Haven't I told you it's dangerous to speed in this area?
At least we're not late.
We will learn a new song today.
It's not time to fool around.
Very well done, Jamal.
They felt good to be praised.
I think we suit each other very well.
How didn't we figure this out earlier.
We can go some other time.
That doesn't seem right at all.
Follow me carefully.
Yellow is my favorite color.
Since that day, they have become very close.
What color do we blend with blue to get green?
Shall we go now, guys?
I can have so much fun just playing by myself.
It's quite tiring doing it all alone.
Where are they flying those kites from?
Can you make me a cup of tea?
Do you wanna come to the riverside with me tomorrow?
You'll like it very much.
I've got great news for you, Fadil.
Jamal has got the tickets.
Fadil must have forgotten his promise to Layla.
Jamal is waiting for Sarah.
I've never gone on a ferry before.
So shall we go now?
Jamal is late again.
When are you coming?
It's all thanks to Jamal.
Our friends are the best.
Why isn't Jamal coming?
Why isn't Jamal coming tonight?
So you wanna do this?
I found something very interesting.
Jamal waited for you all afternoon.
Am I too late, guys?
Where have you been, Jamal?
You didn't leave yet.
I forgot about our plan for today.
Aren't you angry?
So how did you find them?
I guess we are meant to be best friends.
I think it's more fun to play with you.
Let's play together next time.
If I'm elected mayor, I'll make the town great again.
He immediately fell asleep.
As a mayor, I've brought prosperity to our village.
Are you that lost?
By now, he must be starving.
I don't really feel like it.
So you really wanna get rid of me.
A walk after eating is good for health.
A walk after eating is good for digestion.
I know you have a girlfriend. Don't lie to me.
I have started dreaming about you from the moment I set my eyes on you.
You did that to Jamal?
She's married to Jamal.
I don't trust that woman at all.
Sooner or later, she'll betray Jamal.
She's with Jamal.
Jamal adores her.
Jamal would die for her.
Has Jamal been around?
Where did Jamal go?
I give sensational massages.
You'll become totally addicted to my massages.
Do you like watching porn movies?
Do you like visiting porn websites?
Marriage and relationships are slavery.
It's me, Jamal. Call me back.
I haven't been able to reach you all morning. Where are you?
If you don't grab the opportunity, you'll lose it.
Here's the room key.
What are you waiting for? Let's go.
There is not much to say about me.
That's how I live.
I'm studying and also working.
I don't have time to waste, guys.
I was a baby then.
You refuse to give anyone else a chance.
I don't have plans for my immediate future.
You can absolutely do everything you just told me.
I'm a little too young.
Did you manage to call Jamal?
It's unusual for Jamal to go missing without saying anything.
I could eat an elephant.
I hope you'll like them.
I hope you enjoy it.
The important thing is you're here.
Why are you doing this, if I may ask?
I'll never let you go.
I don't know what you're planning to do, but I won't let you do it.
Credit card or cash?
I really need those diapers now.
This is all I have. Take it.
You have to pay the amount shown on the cash register.
You have to understand that I have to go now.
We don't have the right to do this.
Is there a problem, sir?
I really can't help you.
The diapers are for my twins.
You don't have to push me.
I didn't think it was the moment.
Tom played lead guitar.
I know I'm not perfect.
It was clear that Tom didn't want to sing.
How did you get so rich?
Tom had to learn to talk again.
What's the real reason you don't want to go to Boston?
How can I explain this in a way that even Tom would understand?
How can we prevent something like this from happening again?
Tom tried not to cough.
I said the wrong thing.
Has Tom been around?
Tom immediately fell asleep.
Tom must've forgotten his promise to Mary.
Tom must've forgotten what he promised Mary.
Tom must've forgotten what he promised to do for Mary.
Everybody seems to like Tom.
It looks like Tom doesn't know how to ski.
How do I know it's safe?
Tom had to turn down the offer.
It would take at least three hours to paint this room.
Tom thought it would be safe for Mary to walk home by herself.
How young were you when you first started singing on stage?
We'll help Tom do that.
I used to hate spinach.
Is Tom the one who taught you how to sing?
How do you like my gown?
Tom's girlfriend is Canadian.
There was no way I could not have asked Tom that question.
I just had to ask Tom that question.
Stay curious.
I know you and you're nothing.
We had to go back to the drawing board.
You can touch it, if you like.
You can touch it if you want.
Babylon was famous for its hanging gardens.
What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one.
The orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of bees.
Thomas Lynde - a meek little man whom Avonlea people called "Rachel Lynde's husband" - was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn.
Now, where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he going there?
He wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was plain proof that he was going out of Avonlea.
He was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk.
I'll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from Marilla where he's gone and why.
I'm leading a country.
It's no wonder Matthew and Marilla are both a little odd, living away back here by themselves.
Trees aren't much company, though dear knows if they were there'd be enough of them.
A body can get used to anything, even to being hanged, as the Irishman said.
Not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen, for Mrs. Rachel would have seen it if there had been.
Here sat Marilla Cuthbert, when she sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine, which seemed to her too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to be taken seriously.
There were three plates laid, so that Marilla must be expecting someone home with Matthew to tea.
This is a real fine evening, isn't it? Won't you sit down? How are all your folks?
Something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between Marilla Cuthbert and Mrs. Rachel, in spite of—or perhaps because of—their dissimilarity.
Marilla was a tall, thin woman, with angles and without curves; her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it.
She had known that the sight of Matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity.
Matthew went to Bright River. We're getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he's coming on the train tonight.
If Marilla had said that Matthew had gone to Bright River to meet a kangaroo from Australia Mrs. Rachel could not have been more astonished.
"Are you in earnest, Marilla?" she demanded when voice returned to her.
"What on earth put such a notion into your head?" she demanded disapprovingly.
What on earth put such a notion into your head?
This had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be disapproved.
Mrs. Alexander Spencer was up here one day before Christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in Hopeton in the spring.
Matthew is getting up in years, you know—he's sixty—and he isn't so spry as he once was.
We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer today—the mail-man brought it from the station—saying they were coming on the five-thirty train tonight.
Mrs. Rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind.
Well, Marilla, I'll just tell you plain that I think you're doing a mighty foolish thing—a risky thing, that's what.
If you had asked my advice in the matter—which you didn't do, Marilla—I'd have said for mercy's sake not to think of such a thing, that's what.
"Well, I hope it will turn out all right," said Mrs. Rachel in a tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts.
Matthew and Marilla don't know anything about children.
The air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards.
The meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple.
The little birds sang as if it were the one day of summer in all the year.
Matthew dreaded all women except Marilla and Mrs. Rachel; he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him.
He had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty, lacking a little of the grayness.
The long platform was almost deserted; the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end.
There was a passenger dropped off for you—a little girl. She's sitting out there on the shingles.
I asked her to go into the ladies' waiting room, but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside.
She wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat, extending down her back, were two braids of very thick, decidedly red hair.
Her face was small, white and thin, also much freckled.
Her mouth was large and so were her eyes, which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others.
I suppose you are Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables?
I'm very glad to see you. I was beginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me and I was imagining all the things that might have happened to prevent you.
I had made up my mind that if you didn't come for me to-night I'd go down the track to that big wild cherry-tree at the bend, and climb up into it to stay all night.
It would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry-tree all white with bloom in the moonshine, don't you think?
"I'm sorry I was late," he said shyly.
Come along. The horse is over in the yard. Give me your bag.
I don't suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum, so you can't possibly understand what it is like. It's worse than anything you could imagine.
I don't ever expect to be a bride myself. I'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me.
I just love pretty clothes.
I've never had a pretty dress in my life that I can remember.
This morning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear this horrid old wincey dress. All the orphans had to wear them, you know.
Am I talking too much? People are always telling me I do.
Like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it.
Oh, you can talk as much as you like. I don't mind.
Is there a brook anywhere near Green Gables?
It's always been one of my dreams to live near a brook.
Dreams don't often come true, do they? Wouldn't it be nice if they did?
You can't always please everyone.
He gave me a pencil.
How do you start your Monday?
Tom handed me a sheet of paper.
You should seriously consider not doing that anymore.
I'm still waiting for Tom to pay me back the money I lent him.
How was I supposed to know we weren't allowed in that room?
I wish I could help Tom.
I'm interested in that.
I'm sure Tom won't want to sing that song.
How else can we do this?
Tom has a crush on his teacher.
You have to do this. You don't have any other choice.
Tom doesn't think that Mary was the one who stole his bicycle.
How did you like the restaurant that you ate at last night?
I'm glad I was with Tom.
I'm looking for my dog.
I know Tom is going to want to go with us.
How fast can you car go?
Tom has a lot of acquaintances.
We need to learn not to take ourselves too seriously.
I don't see why Tom wouldn't want to go to the dance with you.
How long has it been since you've had a good night's sleep?
Let Tom sing by himself.
I'm not ready to leave.
I hope Tom did what he was supposed to do.
How often do you use it?
Tom has a lot of history books.
It's not uncommon to see Americans kissing in public.
How did you know that Tom's passport was in the bottom drawer?
How could you do such a terrible thing to your own brother?
Tom is afraid of ghosts.
I'm willing to do that.
Tom and Mary don't know anything about children.
Tom and Mary are bad parents.
Tom and Mary are good parents.
What time do we start in the morning?
She was divinely beautiful.
Which would you rather be if you had the choice--divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good?
I've never had a real home since I can remember.
Oh, isn't that pretty!
Here and there a wild plum leaned out from the bank like a white-clad girl tip-toeing to her own reflection.
From the marsh at the head of the pond came the clear, mournfully-sweet chorus of the frogs.
There was a little gray house peering around a white apple orchard on a slope beyond and, although it was not yet quite dark, a light was shining from one of its windows.
"That's Barry's pond," said Matthew.
Oh, I don't like that name, either. I shall call it - let me see - the Lake of Shining Waters. Yes, that is the right name for it.
To the west a dark church spire rose up against a marigold sky.
Below was a little valley and beyond a long, gently-rising slope with snug farmsteads scattered along it.
In the stainless southwest sky, a great crystal-white star was shining like a lamp of guidance and promise.
Oh, it seems as if I must be in a dream.
The yard was quite dark as they turned into it and the poplar leaves were rustling silkily all round it.
"Listen to the trees talking in their sleep," she whispered, as he lifted her to the ground. "What nice dreams they must have!"
Anne is a real good plain sensible name. You've no need to be ashamed of it.
We want a boy to help Matthew on the farm. A girl would be of no use to us.
Matthew Cuthbert, you don't mean to say you think we ought to keep her!
Marilla's astonishment could not have been greater if Matthew had expressed a predilection for standing on his head.
"What good would she be to us?" "We might be some good to her," said Matthew suddenly and unexpectedly.
There's something I don't understand about her.
It was broad daylight when Anne awoke and sat up in bed, staring confusedly at the window through which a flood of cheery sunshine was pouring.
For a moment she could not remember where she was.
A huge cherry-tree grew outside, so close that its boughs tapped against the house, and it was so thick-set with blossoms that hardly a leaf was to be seen.
On both sides of the house was a big orchard, one of apple-trees and one of cherry-trees, also showered over with blossoms; and their grass was all sprinkled with dandelions.
In the garden below were lilac-trees purple with flowers, and their dizzily sweet fragrance drifted up to the window on the morning wind.
Below the garden, a green field lush with clover sloped down to the hollow where the brook ran and where scores of white birches grew.
She had looked on so many unlovely places in her life, poor child; but this was as lovely as anything she had ever dreamed.
Why can't you do that?
I don't think I can stop Tom from leaving.
How bad a driver are you?
Tom has a very expensive watch.
Do you know anyone who might want be able to help us?
How could you not know what was going on between Tom and Mary?
How many people do you think will be at tonight's concert?
Tom is now my assistant.
I've always lived here.
I didn't know that Tom hated Mary so much.
How bad is your headache?
Marilla really did not know how to talk to the child, and her uncomfortable ignorance made her crisp and curt when she did not mean to be.
It's a big tree.
Oh, isn't it wonderful?
I'm so glad there's a brook near Green Gables.
The worst of imagining things is that the time comes when you have to stop and that hurts.
You'd better get dressed and come downstairs.
Breakfast is waiting.
Wash your face and comb your hair.
I'm pretty hungry this morning.
I'm glad it's not rainy today because it's easier to be cheerful and bear up under affliction on a sunshiny day.
"For pity's sake hold your tongue," said Marilla. "You talk entirely too much for a little girl."
She had an uncomfortable feeling that while this odd child's body might be there at the table her spirit was far away in some remote airy cloudland, borne aloft on the wings of imagination.
Who would want such a child about the place? Yet Matthew wished to keep her, of all unaccountable things!
When the meal was ended Anne came out of her reverie and offered to wash the dishes.
"Can you wash dishes right?" asked Marilla distrustfully.
I felt that he was a kindred spirit as soon as ever I saw him.
You're both queer enough, if that's what you mean by kindred spirits.
Yes, you may wash the dishes. Take plenty of hot water, and be sure you dry them well.
After you've finished the dishes go upstairs and make your bed.
"What's the matter now?" demanded Marilla.
There is no use in loving things if you have to be torn from them, is there?
What is the name of that geranium on the window sill?
I named that cherry-tree outside my bedroom window this morning. I called it Snow Queen because it was so white.
Anne had relapsed into reverie, with her chin in her hands and her eyes on the sky.
I'll take Anne with me and Mrs. Spencer will probably make arrangements to send her back to Nova Scotia at once.
I'll be home in time to milk the cows.
There is nothing more aggravating than a man who won't talk back—unless it is a woman who won't.
Oh, look, there's one little early wild rose out! Isn't it lovely?
Wouldn't it be nice if roses could talk? I'm sure they could tell us such lovely things.
Isn't pink the most bewitching color in the world? I love it, but I can't wear it. Redheaded people can't wear pink, not even in imagination.
Well, that is another hope gone. My life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes.
My life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes.
That's a sentence I read in a book once, and I say it over to comfort myself whenever I'm disappointed in anything.
I am so fond of romantic things, and a graveyard full of buried hopes is about as romantic a thing as one can imagine isn't it?
I was born in Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia.
My father's name was Walter Shirley, and he was a teacher in the Bolingbroke High School.
I'm so glad my parents had nice names. It would be a real disgrace to have a father named--well, say Jedediah, wouldn't it?
I read in a book once that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but I've never been able to believe it.
I don't believe a rose would be as nice if it was called a thistle or a skunk cabbage.
My mother was a teacher in the High school, too, but when she married father she gave up teaching, of course. A husband was enough responsibility.
They were as poor as church mice.
They went to live in a weeny-teeny little yellow house in Bolingbroke.
I've never seen that house, but I've imagined it thousands of times.
She died of fever when I was just three months old.
She had twins three times. I like babies in moderation, but twins three times in succession is too much.
Pity was suddenly stirring in her heart for the child.
What a starved, unloved life she had had—a life of drudgery and poverty and neglect.
Isn't the sea wonderful?
That's the White Sands Hotel.
Down at the base of the cliffs were heaps of surf-worn rocks or little sandy coves inlaid with pebbles as with ocean jewels.
Beyond lay the sea, shimmering and blue, and over it soared the gulls, their pinions flashing silvery in the sunlight.
The shore road was woodsy and wild and lonesome.
Once, when I lived in Marysville, Mr. Thomas hired an express wagon and took us all to spend the day at the shore ten miles away.
I enjoyed every moment of that day, even if I had to look after the children all the time.
Mrs. Spencer lived in a big yellow house at White Sands Cove.
I promised Matthew I'd be home early.
Let me introduce you two ladies. Mrs. Blewett, Miss Cuthbert.
Anne, you sit here on the ottoman and don't wiggle.
Let me take your hats.
Flora Jane, go out and put the kettle on.
Please excuse me for just a moment. I forgot to tell Flora Jane to take the buns out of the oven.
How old are you and what's your name?
Mrs. Blewett darted her eyes over Anne from head to foot.
Marilla looked at Anne and softened at the sight of the child's pale face with its look of mute misery--the misery of a helpless little creature who finds itself once more caught in the trap from which it had escaped.
Her eyes grew deep and bright as morning stars.
"I'd rather go back to the asylum than go to live with her," said Anne passionately.
Go back and sit down quietly and hold your tongue and behave as a good girl should.
Matthew's shy face was a glow of delight.
Tom forgot to tell Mary to take the bread out of the oven.
I noticed last night that you threw your clothes all about the floor when you took them off. That is a very untidy habit, and I can't allow it at all.
As soon as you take off any article of clothing fold it neatly and place it on the chair.
Say your prayers now and get into bed.
Tom has always been a musician.
You still haven't done what you were supposed to do.
Tom has been told several times not to sing so late at night.
How difficult was it for you to find a job here in Boston?
Tom said it was a prank.
I don't think it's cold.
How does Tom handle situations like these?
How can I find the truth?
Tom has been arguing with Mary.
You should seriously consider applying for that job.
Do you have any idea who might want be able to help us?
Tom didn't seem to be having any trouble convincing Mary to go out with him.
How confident are you that they will get these repairs completed by Monday?
Why, Anne, what do you mean? Were you never taught to say your prayers?
God always wants little girls to say their prayers.
Why must people kneel down to pray? If I really wanted to pray I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd go out into a great big field all alone or into the deep, deep, woods, and I'd look up into the sky--up--up--up--into that lovely blue sky that looks as if there was no end to its blueness. And then I'd just feel a prayer.
Let me take your coats.
My mother died when I was just three months old.
Her most serious shortcoming seemed to be a tendency to fall into daydreams in the middle of a task and forget all about it until such time as she was sharply recalled to earth by a reprimand or a catastrophe.
Matthew and I have decided to keep you — that is, if you will try to be a good little girl and show yourself grateful.
Why, child, whatever is the matter?
"I'm crying," said Anne in a tone of bewilderment. "I can't think why. I'm glad as glad can be."
"Do you never imagine things different from what they really are?" asked Anne wide-eyed. "No."
When the Lord puts us in certain circumstances He doesn't mean for us to imagine them away.
I thought you said we weren't going to go to Boston with Tom.
How can I lower my high blood pressure without medication?
Tom told me not to sing.
I love playing football.
How do you know Tom won't want to do that?
How can it get any worse?
Tom has done that a lot lately.
Would you like to join me and my friend for a drink?
I think it's pretty obvious that Tom doesn't want to do that.
How long is it going to be before the heat comes back on?
Tom told us not to sing.
I really enjoy swimming.
How do we know that Tom wrote this letter?
How could it be my fault?
Tom has dozens of French books.
Why would you want to go there if you don't have to?
I think asking Tom to be your partner would be a big mistake.
How much more money would it cost to buy the larger size?
Tom hired Mary to help.
I still have to do that.
How did Tom know you could play the piano?
How did we get this deal?
Tom has enough money to buy it.
We have to deal with that before the end of the day.
I think it's pretty obvious that Tom doesn't want to be here.
How would you like it if I gossiped about your children?
Why isn't Tom resigning?
I'm thrilled to be here.
How did Tom know that was going to happen?
How did you get that job?
I promised Tom I'd be home early.
I promised Tom I'd be home by 2:30.
I promised Tom I wouldn't do that.
I told Tom I'd be home this evening.
Tom has good chance of winning.
We have no choice but to do what they told us to do.
I realized later that the person I was talking to wasn't Tom.
How could you do something like that to your own brother?
Why was Tom there alone?
I cried when my dog died.
How could Tom not know what the rules are?
How did you get the idea?
Tom has had plenty of practice.
We aren't rich enough to buy a house on Park Street.
How could I have known Tom would get so upset by my comments?
How much time did it take you to come up with this plan?
How did Tom get up there?
I don't want to eat that.
How can Tom possibly do what you're doing?
How do we deal with that?
Tom has helped me in many ways.
They don't realize that we know they're lying to us.
Tom said that he had expected something different to happen.
How much time does it take to master a foreign language?
I bet Tom could help you.
I just want you to leave.
Do you know all of Tom's children's names?
How do you like my dress?
Tom has just bought a used car.
It would take at least three hours to get this done.
Should we tell Tom he doesn't need to be at today's meeting?
I didn't ask Tom to sing.
I know I can do this job.
If I wasn't a human girl, I think I'd like to be a bee and live among the flowers.
"If I wasn't a human girl I think I'd like to be a bee and live among the flowers." "Yesterday you wanted to be a sea gull," sniffed Marilla. "I think you are very fickle minded."
Come here, child, and let me have a look at you.
Anne, go to your room and stay there until I come up.
Her temper matches her hair, I guess.
Oh, but there's such a difference between saying a thing yourself and hearing other people say it.
It was a dreadful thing for you to lose your temper like that, Anne.
"Just imagine how you would feel if somebody told you to your face that you were skinny and ugly," pleaded Anne tearfully.
Oh, no, I'm not vexed—don't worry yourself. I'm too sorry for you to leave any room for anger in my mind.
You must go to her and tell her you are very sorry for your bad temper and ask her to forgive you.
"I can never do that," said Anne determinedly and darkly. "You can punish me in any way you like, Marilla. You can shut me up in a dark, damp dungeon inhabited by snakes and toads and feed me only on bread and water and I shall not complain. But I cannot ask Mrs. Lynde to forgive me."
I can't tell Mrs. Lynde I'm sorry I said those things to her. How can I? I'm not sorry.
It's a good thing Rachel Lynde got a calling down; she's a meddlesome old gossip.
She's a meddlesome old gossip.
I reckon she ought to be punished a little. But don't be too hard on her, Marilla.
He had never been upstairs in his own house since the spring he helped Marilla paper the spare bedroom, and that was four years ago.
Anne was sitting on the yellow chair by the window gazing mournfully out into the garden.
Don't you think you'd better do it and have it over with?
It'll have to be done sooner or later, you know.
I'm sorry I lost my temper and said rude things.
I'm a dreadfully wicked and ungrateful girl, and I deserve to be punished and cast out by respectable people forever.
Run along, child.
She certainly is an odd child.
Anne came out of the fragrant twilight of the orchard with a sheaf of white narcissi in her hands.
I hope you'll try to control your temper now, Anne.
You shouldn't think so much about your looks, Anne. I'm afraid you are a very vain little girl.
Aren't the stars bright tonight?
If you could live in a star, which one would you pick? I'd like that lovely clear big one away over there above that dark hill.
If you could live in a star, which one would you pick?
It's lovely to be going home and know it's home.
I love Green Gables already, and I never loved any place before. No place ever seemed like home.
"Saying one's prayers isn't exactly the same thing as praying," said Anne meditatively.
Anne was standing in the gable room, looking solemnly at three new dresses spread out on the bed.
Oh, I can see you don't like the dresses! What is the matter with them?
Puffed sleeves are so fashionable now. It would give me such a thrill, Marilla, just to wear a dress with puffed sleeves.
I'd rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and sensible all by myself.
Don't stare at people and don't fidget.
They looked at her and whispered to each other behind their quarterlies.
Miss Rogerson was a middle-aged lady who had taught a Sunday-school class for twenty years.
Every other little girl in the class had puffed sleeves. Anne felt that life was really not worth living without puffed sleeves.
Well, how did you like Sunday school?
I didn't like it a bit. It was horrid.
The sermon was awfully long.
You'd better not let Tom see you do that.
How do you make a living?
Tom has just finished his work.
Do you have any idea who actually wrote this letter?
It was obvious that Tom didn't want to take out the garbage.
How do you think that this situation should be resolved?
I think Tom was in shock.
I need someplace to hide.
Why do you let Tom treat you that way?
How far is it to the zoo?
Tom has made the baseball team.
You aren't really going to sing that song, are you?
I don't think Tom will ever be able to sing as well as Mary.
How long do you think it'll take you to accomplish that?
Let Tom do what he wants.
I was definitely worried.
We need to find Tom as quickly as we can.
How long can I stay here?
Tom has never flown in a plane.
Why didn't you tell me you'd already paid the bill?
The meeting was awfully long.
The meeting was very long.
I hope you'll try to control your temper from now on.
Tom certainly is an odd kid.
Tom certainly is a strange kid.
Tom certainly is a talented kid.
Can I go?
Guess again.
Tom sniffed.
I must do it.
I teased Tom.
I suggested it.
It isn't heavy.
I feel very sad.
It's past eight.
Give me your bag.
It's so pathetic.
I feel so excited.
Isn't that pretty?
Tom lent it to me.
Well, what's next?
I insist upon that.
I must go home now.
I've been insulted.
Tom was a nice boy.
Where are the oars?
Can't we be friends?
I'll try to be good.
I think Tom likes it.
I'll do my very best.
I'm ready to confess.
Tom is a famous cook.
Tom is too outspoken.
Tom won't forgive me.
You're so kind to me.
Am I talking too much?
Everything was lovely.
How did the others do?
I guess you're hungry.
Tom's ankle is broken.
Begin at the beginning.
I didn't like it a bit.
I liked it pretty well.
I'll do all the chores.
Tom is a real good man.
Tom's mind was made up.
Doesn't Mary look lovely?
Excuse me a minute, Tom.
I can't stay here alone.
I made so many mistakes.
They're always laughing.
Tom was such an odd boy.
We'll never forget this.
What spices did you use?
Why didn't anybody come?
I asked Tom all about it.
I don't speak to Tom now.
I hope I didn't hurt Tom.
I hope you appreciate it.
I was born in that house.
I'd love to be a teacher.
Isn't that too expensive?
Let me tell you my plans.
That was why I confessed.
Tom looked rather scared.
Tom told me you did that.
I never noticed it before.
Tell me the truth at once.
Tom was talking about you.
I can't go to school today.
It's tremendously exciting.
Tom looked rather relieved.
What flavoring did you use?
What would you advise, Tom?
Why don't you like it here?
I felt so ashamed of myself.
I hope you were a good girl.
I'm really glad you like it.
It's a kind of pretty place.
One of the doors was broken.
Tom is a very religious man.
Tom's hair isn't red, is it?
I guess I'll have to do that.
Is Tom going to school today?
It was a very lonesome place.
Has Tom eaten anything at all?
I heard Tom playing the piano.
Don't you worry about me a bit.
What on earth did you give Tom?
Would you rather I didn't help?
Would you rather I didn't stay?
Would you rather I didn't talk?
Would you like to be an elephant?
Would you rather I didn't leave?
I wrote that last Monday evening.
I don't want to get there too soon.
I knew you couldn't guess the answer.
I wouldn't have dyed my hair that color.
Tom asked me if I knew anyone who spoke French.
Don't fidget.
Comb your hair.
Did you touch it?
We're nearly home.
Take off your boots.
Tom is awfully sick.
I wish I had dimples.
It was our own fault.
I guess once is enough.
I'll be back next year.
I'll get up at sunrise.
Tom says you're bright.
I didn't mean to meddle.
I know I'll be punished.
I suppose I'd better go.
I'm glad Tom liked them.
I'm such an unlucky guy.
I forgot to ask Tom that.
I know just how Tom felt.
Tom made me promise that.
Don't you know who Tom is?
I feel tempted to do that.
I have it all planned out.
I knew you could beat Tom.
That was a thrilling book.
Tom has a very bad temper.
Tom nearly fell overboard.
I know Tom will be furious.
It's extremely interesting.
Tom is a very generous man.
Tom is such a sensible man.
Tomorrow is Tom's birthday.
My mind is quite made up.
I think that's all nonsense.
I'm so glad it's warm today.
They always made us do that.
Tom asked no more questions.
I've been crying like a baby.
It was Tom's idea to do that.
Tom came home this afternoon.
Tom is a very particular man.
I answered a lot of questions.
I didn't let Tom in the house.
I hope you didn't disturb Tom.
I know we can help each other.
I was so tired I couldn't eat.
I wish I didn't have to leave.
Please excuse me for a minute.
What've you done to your hair?
Have tea ready when I get back.
How on earth did you get there?
I think I've sprained my ankle.
I'm afraid Tom won't let me go.
I'm going to Boston in October.
Tom didn't say much about that.
You don't know how tired I was.
Can you tell me why that's true?
Have tea ready when I come back.
I know I'll have to be punished.
I know you'll tell me the truth.
I love a book that makes me cry.
I never expected Tom to do that.
I suppose you'd like to see Tom.
I think I did fairly well today.
I wish I didn't have to do that.
I'll just talk it over with Tom.
That's what I was trying to say.
Tom is good at asking questions.
Tom looked dubious for a moment.
Tom must be a great help to you.
Tom, what's the matter with you?
Why was Tom here this afternoon?
Can you tell me why you think so?
I don't mind being beaten by Tom.
I knew you could beat Tom easily.
I'll try not to think about that.
It was stupid to do such a thing.
Please tell me why you're crying.
That's a very comforting thought.
Tom opened the box and peeped in.
What time did I tell you to come?
Who was that you were talking to?
Why do people kneel down to pray?
Tom has been a faithful friend.
Are you going to apologize to Tom?
Can you tell me why that happened?
I was mistaken and I'm glad I was.
I've grown two inches this summer.
The sermon was awfully long today.
Tom wouldn't speak to Mary at all.
Were we really there half an hour?
Do I really look the same as usual?
I don't know what else can be done.
I had a headache all day yesterday.
I wish I had something to give Tom.
If Tom isn't your name, what is it?
Please excuse me for just a minute.
Please excuse me for just a moment.
Tom is such a sympathetic listener.
Let me hear what you have to say.
Don't answer me back like that, Tom.
Everyone says Tom will win the race.
I don't know what on earth you mean.
I never make the same mistake twice.
Is there a river anywhere near here?
There's plenty of food in the house.
I don't approve of such goings-on.
I'm sure I know just how Tom felt.
Do you honestly think we can do this?
How dare you call me skinny and ugly?
I can just imagine myself doing that.
I'll never be able to live this down.
What time did I tell you to get here?
Wouldn't it be nice if they did that?
You'd better let Tom do that for you.
That has been my experience anyhow.
That's something I won't encourage.
Are we going to be friends after this?
Dreams don't often come true, do they?
Everybody has forgotten about Tom and me.
Everybody says Tom will win the prize.
I knew Tom was up to some foolishness.
I wish I didn't have to leave so soon.
Puffed sleeves are so fashionable now.
Take off your boots now and go to bed.
Tom didn't think he needed a new coat.
Tom looked as if he were ready to cry.
You'll go to school tomorrow as usual.
Do you think you'll be able to do that?
I had no real idea what it looked like.
I want to tell you about what happened.
Let me introduce you two to each other.
Neither of them knew what to say or do.
Our potato crop is very good this year.
Tom cried all the way home from school.
Tom is going to lend me a book to read.
I haven't yet read the book Tom lent me.
I'd like to know why you didn't obey me.
I'm afraid you've been working too hard.
It all depends on the way we look at it.
People are always telling me to do that.
Tom got awfully sick and had to go home.
Tom needs your help much more than I do.
Tom was afraid Mary wouldn't notice him.
Were we really there for thirty minutes?
Where were you born and how old are you?
I'm extremely grateful to you and Tom.
I don't ever expect to be a bride myself.
I don't think we can do anything for Tom.
I just laughed because everyone else did.
I've been thinking about you all morning.
If I were a man, I think I'd be a priest.
Isn't that something to be proud of, Tom?
Sit down here and tell me about yourself.
There's no use trying to reason with Tom.
Tom wasn't dressed like the other boys.
Can you tell me why you think that's true?
I need to think of something funny to say.
Tom looks lonely and sad, don't you think?
Will your parents let you stay home today?
You're so much more dignified than I am.
Do you suppose it will make any difference?
I don't think we can do anything right now.
I know we can help each other in many ways.
I wish my imagination was as good as yours.
It's worse than anything you could imagine.
Suppose Tom wasn't really going to do that.
I don't think we can do anything about that.
I thought nothing could be as bad as cancer.
It was very silly of you to do such a thing.
Wouldn't it be nice if they did that for us?
I can't tell you what a thrill it gave me.
I couldn't help fearing I'd only imagined it.
I wouldn't forgive Tom even if he apologized.
It does really seem as if I must be dreaming.
Perhaps Tom will think I tried to poison him.
The less fuss made the better, in my opinion.
I'm sure it must have been very disturbing.
Tom can't be much different from ourselves.
I couldn't love anybody as much as I love you.
I might've known nobody really wanted me here.
Tom has something very important to tell Mary.
I knew things were going too smooth to last.
I can't do this, so please don't ask me to try.
I wish I didn't have to go to Boston next week.
Tom opened his eyes and looked around the room.
I'll try not to think about what might go wrong.
We want to hire someone to help Tom on the farm.
I don't like children who ask a lot of questions.
I'd like to know why you didn't just wait for Tom.
I'm better at looking after children than you are.
Tom certainly needs your help much more than I do.
Tom wants to rent our farm for the next few years.
I suppose I'd better go and talk to Tom about that.
People are always telling me I have beautiful eyes.
Tom wanted to know when Mary was going to come home.
Wouldn't it be nice if this warm weather could last?
The only reason I laughed was because everyone else did.
You don't know what you're getting for Christmas, do you?
I'd like to know why you didn't do what I asked you to do.
People are always telling me that I speak French very well.
Life was certainly very interesting when we lived in Boston.
I'll try not to think about everything that needs to be done.
I've been so happy.
I've been here for a year.
I do hope you won't be offended.
Baseball season hasn't begun yet.
I'm glad you've come to live with us.
I guess I was a little too hard on you.
It wasn't as hard as you might imagine.
I'm awfully sorry I made fun of your hair.
These headaches of mine are getting worse.
It'll be fun to have somebody to play with.
Next Monday would be a good time to do that.
You won't keep me from doing that, will you?
For a moment, I couldn't remember where I was.
I saw Tom pick it up and put it in his pocket.
There's something I don't understand about Tom.
Sit down on that chair and try to calm yourself.
You're not going to the picnic and that's final.
We've decided to give you the loan you requested.
Don't you think that's a very strange coincidence?
I'm really very healthy even though I'm very thin.
Next Monday would be a good time for you to visit.
I actually thought Tom was going to choke to death.
These headaches of mine are getting worse and worse.
I've been expecting something like this to happen for some time.
I've been expecting something like this to happen for a long time.
It's kind of you, Fadil.
You mean you spent the entire morning with Jamal?
Don't exaggerate, Jamal.
How old are you really? Don't lie to me.
Alright. Let's see what we can do.
I need permission from your parents or guardian.
Come and have some.
Here's some ice.
You're all wet.
Pass the salt please.
"I didn't go to my classes." "How come?"
Where did you get to?
She lives on the outskirts of the city.
You look you've just returned from a safari in the savannah.
I'd rather die than do something like this.
I got very thirsty.
We found a stream and swam a little bit.
Why didn't you invite him in?
Were they really good-looking?
Did you ask him his number?
The only thing everybody here wants is for you to find someone you'd be happy with.
"I love you." "I love you, too."
He didn't give us his previous employment record.
Would that be difficult?
When does he get back?
In one month, you'll have to give me your guardian's authorization, otherwise, we'll not keep you.
She's on probation for the moment.
You're still in your probation period.
She's new here. Please show her around.
He looks like a gangster.
I'm a little behind with my work.
Your fiancee was looking for you.
I'm waiting for a phone call from that friend of mine.
Would you take a look at this beautiful baby?
I thought you would never call me.
She didn't like coffee.
I'll get outside.
I can't hear you well. I'll get outside.
You call me if anything else happens.
What did you tell your friend?
I'll go over and see her.
Don't bother yourself.
Tom couldn't afford to pay for his mother's funeral.
Tom isn't exactly a model student.
I don't know anyone here, except for Tom.
What you said earlier at that table really moved me.
I'll give you the anesthetic.
It's not gonna hurt.
You can't leave like this.
You can take off the bandage tomorrow.
What type of work does Tom do?
What kind of work does Tom do?
I don't have much experience driving on the right side of the road.
Stop interrupting me.
I've had a crush on you since the first time I met you.
I should've paid more attention in school.
I should've been paying more attention in class.
I should've paid more attention in class.
Tom was here a few minutes ago.
Everyone knows that Tom and Mary like each other.
Tom says that he wasn't surprised at all.
This restaurant has a romantic atmosphere.
Tom would be furious if he knew what you did.
Advertising campaigns have shaped popular culture, and launched brand into the public eye
We're not going to lose.
I'm not responsible for what Tom has done.
Stop wasting time.
Tom invited me to stay at his place in Boston for spring break.
Tom says he won't stay.
I don't mind doing that.
I don't want any dinner.
I'll never come back here.
Tom tried to talk to Mary.
Can you wash dishes tonight?
I don't want anything to eat.
You shouldn't talk about Tom.
Did you hear what I said, Tom?
I love Tom with my whole heart.
Tom tells me you have a garden.
I think you ought to let Tom go.
Mary is having a new dress made.
I'm not coming back here anymore.
I'll tell Tom as soon as he comes.
Tom will never believe what I did.
I think you ought to let Tom leave.
Tom isn't where I told him to wait.
What can I do for you this evening?
It wasn't a particularly good movie.
Take those flowers out of your hair.
I didn't think anybody could do that.
Tom is only three years older than us.
In my opinion, you ought to let Tom go.
Don't tell Tom I said anything about it.
Tom almost wished he had never met Mary.
Tom stayed with the Jacksons that night.
I'm very glad you feel the same way I do.
When I got there, Tom met me at the door.
Why are you taking all those things home?
I think you ought to let Tom go home early.
My opinion is that you ought to let Tom go.
I'll go over to Tom's early tomorrow morning.
I think you ought to let Tom do what he wants.
I was so excited that I couldn't sleep a wink.
What are you taking all those things home for?
I thought you had promised to give that to Tom.
Where was Tom going and why was he going there?
Do you suppose we'll ever be asked to do that?
Tom will never believe that I did it on purpose.
Tom says we can have all the apples on this tree.
I wonder how Tom and Mary are enjoying themselves.
Do you think there's any chance of that happening?
Tom is staying at the same hotel where I'm staying.
Do you remember what happened on this day last year?
Tom looks a lot like his father did at the same age.
Tom softly closed the door and tiptoed over to Mary.
For a moment, it looked as if Tom might start crying.
I think you ought to let Tom go to Boston by himself.
Tom's birthday is in October and mine is in November.
I guess you're going to do that no matter what we say.
I forgot to tell Tom to take the cookies out of the oven.
It's not the first time Tom has done something like that.
