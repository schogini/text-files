What can go wrong will go wrong.
Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.
Everything that can go wrong will go wrong.
Anything that can possibly go wrong, does.
If anything can go wrong, it will.
Anything that can go wrong, will—at the worst possible moment.
Hope for the best, expect the worst.

When you toss a coin, the more strongly you want heads, the more likely it is to come up tails.
My computer crashed just as I was about to hit "send".
Microsoft Word crashes whenever I try to save.
Save frequently.
Misunderstandings and neglect create more confusion in this world than trickery and malice. At any rate, the last two are certainly much less frequent.
Let us not attribute to malice and cruelty what may be referred to less criminal motives. Do we not often afflict others undesignedly, and, from mere carelessness, neglect to relieve distress?

I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.
We see things only as we are constructed to see them, and can gain no idea of their absolute nature.
With five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the boundlessly complex cosmos, yet other beings with wider, stronger, or different range of senses might not only see very differently the things we see, but might see and study whole worlds of matter, energy, and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the senses we have.
Disintegration is quite painless, I assure you.
No new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace.
The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.
The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.
Life has never interested me so much as the escape from life.
Men will always tremble at the thought of the hidden and fathomless worlds of strange life which may pulsate in the gulfs beyond the stars.
I am writing this under an appreciable mental strain, since by tonight I shall be no more. Penniless, and at the end of my supply of the drug which alone makes life endurable, I can bear the torture no longer; and shall cast myself from this garret window into the squalid street below.
