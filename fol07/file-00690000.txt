What did your kidnapper look like?
Would you answer a few questions?
Have you thought about how Tom might feel about that?
Do you want to know who she is?
How do you plan to celebrate?
Tom said he wanted to learn how to tie a square knot.
Only teenagers can do that.
That was the first time I'd ever eaten Chinese food.
Does Tom take care of you or do you take care of him?
Don't you want to know who that girl is?
Do you really think it's worth the price they're asking?
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston any longer.

Do your parents let you do that at home?
Where did you go to kindergarten?
Tom started crying when I told him his dog had died.
Isn't that what you wanted to say?
Don't you want us to do that?
Wouldn't you like to know why Tom isn't here today?
Do you think it really matters?
Very few people would disagree with that statement.
Tom said he wanted to try to swim across this river.
Let's go swimming together.
How much more do we have to do before we can go home?
Who did Tom say was going to go to Boston with him?
Do you still do all the cooking at home?
Do you think it's possible to do that?
Tom didn't think Mary would go to Boston by herself.
Isn't that what you wanted to buy?
What'll you do when that happens?
If you don't mind telling me, how does Tom do that?
Do you know who's been invited?
Don't you recognize my voice?
I'm pretty sure Tom doesn't have a driver's license.
I won't report any of this.
My mother didn't bake me a birthday cake this year.
Does Tom think he'll be able to do that by himself?
Do you really think you need to do that?
How long do you think it'll take you to do that?
I wasn't able to do everything Tom said I had to do.
Is there anything you need to buy?
Do you realize how ridiculous that is?
Does Tom seriously think anybody will vote for him?
Do you know what this thing is?
What time did you lock the rooms?
I wasn't able to buy everything Tom asked me to buy.
I wanted to dance with you.
Don't you ever wash your dog?
Does Tom seriously think Mary will go out with him?
Do you know why I'm supposed to do that?
If you don't do what the boss says, he'll fire you.
I suggest you don't do what Tom tells you not to do.
If you don't believe me, who will?
Have you ever seen something like this happen before?
Do you know why Tom doesn't live in Boston anymore?

I knew it was just a prank.
What do you think about that now?
Do you have any idea how long Tom stayed in Boston?

Tom paid the taxi driver twice what the meter said.
Have you seen a doctor about that?
How many of Tom's paintings have you sold for him?
Do we have to do anything else?
I don't think I'm hungry enough to eat all of this.
Tom has a tendency to say things that he shouldn't.
I don't know any Canadians.
Don't you want to talk about what happened yesterday?
Don't you want to see the school that Tom went to?
Are you worried about what might happen?
Did you come up with that on your own?
I wasn't able to do everything Tom wanted me to do.
Have you had any successes lately?
Was that what you were expecting?
Does Tom really understand what's going to happen?
Did you take photos last night?
Do you resent our being here?
I thought you said you didn't see Tom this morning.
I didn't go swimming today.
Perhaps you should wait until tomorrow to do that.
Do you want to know why I didn't help Tom do that?
Are you sure this plan is going to work?
Do you want to know who is going to be here tomorrow?
I asked Tom to show my some pictures of his family.
Have you all thought this through?
Can you meet me at my office at 2:30?
Did Tom really say this wouldn't cost us anything?
Can you get the job done today?
Isn't that what you wanted to do?
Tom was shocked when I told him what had happened.
I did that three weeks ago.
Do you all even care anymore?
Wouldn't you like to know why Tom didn't do that?
Are you satisfied with the service here?
I thought you said you didn't know how to do that.
Tom says he has a lot to do before he can go home.
Has all your money made you happy?
Do I really need to be at the meeting this afternoon?
Is there any chance Tom was the one who did that?
Can you believe I'm doing this?
Can you help get me out my wheelchair?
Tom sat on the dock, looking at children swimming.
Everybody needs to do this.
Is this the best we can hope for?
Does Tom think he's still the strongest one here?
Are you going to play golf next weekend?
Did you hear anyone laughing?
Tom said he didn't want to go to Boston with Mary.
Don't you want us to wait for you?
I think you should wait until tomorrow to do that.
Does Tom know what Mary is going to do next year?
Aren't you planning to do that?
Did you hear about what happened here this afternoon?
Tom pretended he didn't know how to open the safe.
You should try to do that.
Are you quite sure it's OK to do this?
Do you want to know why Tom quit going to school?
Are there things that we can do to help?
Is there anything you need to do?
Tom isn't likely to want to go to Boston with you.
Don't you want to try another one?
Did I tell you about my book?
Do you have any idea how long Tom studied French?
Aren't you going to go with us?
I have several friends who used to live in Boston.
Tom deleted all of Mary's pictures from his phone.
You can do so much better.

Are you really planning to go to Boston with Tom?
You don't know what's going on, do you?
Are you going to do that anytime soon?
Tom asked Mary to teach him how to play the flute.
