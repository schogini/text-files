Before he had been a month in Avonlea he had won the reputation of being an odd person . . . "a crank," Mrs. Rachel Lynde said.
That's what I would do in your place.
I don't want to talk to you now.
As for washing dishes, Mr. Harrison never made any pretence of doing it unless a rainy Sunday came. Then he went to work and washed them all at once in the rainwater hogshead, and left them to drain dry.
When he was asked to subscribe to the Rev. Mr. Allan's salary he said he'd wait and see how many dollars' worth of good he got out of his preaching first.
Mr. Harrison kept a parrot called Ginger.
Nobody in Avonlea had ever kept a parrot before.
Mr. Harrison could not have been considered a handsome man; he was short and fat and bald; and now, with his round face purple with rage and his prominent blue eyes almost sticking out of his head, Anne thought he was really the ugliest person she had ever seen.
I'm not going to put up with this.
"Will you explain what the trouble is?" asked Anne, in her most dignified manner.
The trouble is, miss, that I found that Jersey cow of your aunt's in my oats again, not half an hour ago.
I am very sorry that my cow should have broken into your oats.
"I am very sorry," repeated Anne firmly, "but perhaps if you kept your fences in better repair Dolly might not have broken in. It is your part of the line fence that separates your oatfield from our pasture and I noticed the other day that it was not in very good condition."
"My fence is all right," snapped Mr. Harrison, angrier than ever.
A jail fence couldn't keep a demon of a cow like that out.
Mr. Harrison was very sensitive about his bald head.
His anger choked him up.
I don't know how many aunts he has got. That's the fourth that's died since he was hired here a year ago.
Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.
There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection.
I think she was impressed.
You did very well. I think he was impressed.
Mary said Dora was really a very good child but that Davy was full of mischief.
Few things in Avonlea ever escaped Mrs. Lynde.
"I think he is a very disagreeable man," said Anne, with a resentful toss of her ruddy head.
I knew there'd be trouble when Robert Bell sold his place to a New Brunswick man, that's what.
I don't know what Avonlea is coming to, with so many strange people rushing into it. It'll soon not be safe to go to sleep in our beds.
Don't play with that.
I asked you not to play with that.
Nobody knows anything about them.
Mrs Lynde looked upon all people who had the misfortune to be born or brought up elsewhere than in Prince Edward Island with a decided can-any-good-thing-come-out-of-Nazareth air. They might be good people, of course; but you were on the safe side in doubting it.
She had a special prejudice against "Yankees." Her husband had been cheated out of ten dollars by an employer for whom he had once worked in Boston and neither angels nor principalities nor powers could have convinced Mrs. Rachel that the whole United States was not responsible for it.
She has been very lonesome since her husband died.
What's this I hear about your going to start up a Village Improvement Society, Anne?
Her gray eyes lit up until they looked like evening stars.
Diana wasn't exactly sure what educating public sentiment meant; but it sounded fine and she felt rather proud that she was going to belong to a society with such an aim in view.

It is often debated is whether animal experimentation for the development of cosmetics or pharmaceuticals is justified. Many oppose such experimentation on the basis that it causes unnecessary suffering. I argue that it is harmful to animals, unneeded for humans, and morally wrong.
These animals go through horrific experiences during their short lives merely so that the users of the cosmetics can have slightly more attractive features.
The discrepancy between the high moral cost of inflicting pain on these creatures and the insignificant benefit of improving one's appearance is such that the latter cannot be said to outweigh the former.
Though animal experimentation is often argued to be necessary for life-saving medical research, this is often not the case.
Many animal studies unambiguously show certain substances to be poisonous or of medical value in animals, but the results of later studies conducted on humans show that these effects do not occur in people. In other words, the results of these animal studies were useless for producing information of benefit to humans.
Perhaps it may be objected that some animal studies do in fact demonstrate effects similar to those that are later shown to produced in humans. However, the high false positive rate of animal studies in regards to human applicability make them morally dubious.
Many of the types of experiments conducted on animals would never be considered acceptable for human subjects, a fact which demonstrates the existence of an ethical double standard.
Animal experimentation may involve removing organs for no medical reasons, exposing animals to high quantities of toxic or potentially toxic substances, and numerous other procedures that, if performed on humans, would be grounds for prosecution of the experimenter.
It may be objected that humans, as opposed to animals, have intelligence, and therefore have the right not to be experimented upon. However, many humans, such as the mentally disabled, those in vegetative states, or babies, either have no intelligence or limited intelligence, and yet no one is arguing they should be subjected to involuntary, damaging experiments.
In conclusion, animal experimentation is both morally wrong and of limited practical value. It is morally far more costly than the cosmetic products it produces, significantly flawed as a tool for medical research, and its practice in the absence of similar human experimentation is an ethical double standard.
Indoor environments often contain elevated levels of carbon dioxide and lowered levels of oxygen. Studies have shown that such conditions lead to reduced cognitive ability as well as negative health effects; this is detrimental to students' academic performance as well as their overall health.
This improves students' learning in the short term by improving their cognitive function, as well as in the long term by preventing illness that could distract from their studies.
Space research and exploration are scientific enterprises that are crucial for the progress and continued survival of humanity.
There are many reasons why supporting space research is important.
Space has an infinite amount of resources that could be useful for humans.
Satellites provide information that has a significant impact on fields such as meteorology and climate science, as well as agriculture, thus improving crop yields and extending our scientific knowledge of the earth.
Space research is necessary to ensure that mankind is not wiped out by global catastrophes of cosmic origin, such as meteor strikes.
Human exploration to, and settlement of, other planets ensures that if a terrible event does happen on earth, humans will still exist on other planets.
Space research is necessary for the propagation and continuation of the human species.

The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.

The mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for.
The human race is a monotonous affair. Most people spend the greatest part of their time working in order to live, and what little freedom remains so fills them with fear that they seek out any and every means to be rid of it.
All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree. All these aspirations are directed toward ennobling man's life, lifting it from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the individual towards freedom.
The purpose of life is to contribute in some way to making things better.
It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much. ... The life we receive is not short but we make it so; we are not ill provided but use what we have wastefully.
Time lost is time when we have not lived a full human life, time unenriched by experience, creative endeavor, enjoyment, and suffering. Time lost is time not filled, time left empty.
The cities, the roads, the countryside, the people I meet - they all begin to blur. I tell myself I am searching for something.

I had no idea where I was.
Slaves, though held by the laws of men, are free by the laws of God.
That men should pray and fight for their own freedom, and yet keep others in slavery, is certainly acting a very inconsistent, as well as unjust and, perhaps, impious part.
Our people had been so long accustomed to the practice and convenience of having slaves, that very few among them even doubted the propriety and rectitude of it.
It is much to be wished that slavery may be abolished. The honour of the States, as well as justice and humanity, in my opinion, loudly call upon them to emancipate these unhappy people. To contend for our own liberty, and to deny that blessing to others, involves an inconsistency not to be excused.
It is too true, however disgraceful it may be to human nature, that nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it; nay, absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but for the purposes and objects merely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personal affronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans. These and a variety of other motives, which affect only the mind of the sovereign, often lead him to engage in wars not sanctified by justice or the voice and interests of his people.
