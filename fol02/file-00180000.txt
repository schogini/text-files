To me, there aren't any fundamental differences between the cultures of these two countries.
We're all human beings, so in my opinion each country's culture is 90% the same.
Although people like to focus on the differences, I think that on the whole it's the same.
When answering this question, some people might put forward this kind of example: "Chinese people are very hospitable, whilst English people are more reserved."
Maybe this opinion is correct.
However, I've never been a guest in an English household that wasn't generous.
It seems that everyone likes to be generous in welcoming guests to their home.
If there are genuine differences between these two cultures, I think that the largest are certainly in what you think about foreigners studying your native language.
I think that English people might be more used to language learners than people in other countries.
This is due to English being a world language.
There are many people in the world studying English, so English people are used to learners' non-standard accents, their grammatical errors and so on.
The result is that English people usually have no problem understanding what foreigners say.
Of course, another explanation of this situation is that Chinese is harder to learn than English.
Furthermore, I still don't think this a huge cultural difference.

The major religions in China are Taoism, Buddhism, Islam and Christianity.
Of these, Taoism is a native religion, the others having been introduced from foreign lands.
Taoism was founded on the teachings of Laozi, a sage born in B.C. in present-day Henan Province.
He taught contemplation as a means of spiritual purification and the attainment of the Dao, a principle that signifies the highest spiritual ideals of mankind.
His teachings are incorporated in a profound book Daode Jing which Taoists regard as the final authority and doctrines of the religion.
It is generally believed that Buddhism first came to China in A.D. during the reign of Emperor Mingdi of the Eastern Han Dynasty.

We do not travel to travel, but to have traveled.
Magic words and incantations are as fatal to our science as they are to any other.

The hope is illusion.

Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the government's purposes are beneficent.

Decency, security, and liberty alike demand that government officials shall be subjected to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen.

A word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanging, it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in colour and content according to the circumstances and time in which it is used.
The character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done.
The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.
Detached reflection cannot be demanded in the presence of an uplifted knife.
A page of history is worth a volume of logic.

The welfare of the farmer is vital to that of the whole country.
We are all imperfect. We cannot expect perfect government.
I am in favor of helping the prosperity of all countries because, when we are all prosperous, the trade of each becomes more valuable to the other.
I love judges, and I love courts. They are my ideals, that typify on earth what we shall meet hereafter in heaven under a just God.
The world is not going to be saved by legislation.
The President cannot make clouds to rain and cannot make the corn to grow, he cannot make business good; although when these things occur, political parties do claim some credit for the good things that have happened in this way.
If all the medicine in the world were thrown into the sea, it would be bad for the fish and good for humanity.
The sound of a kiss is not so loud as that of a cannon, but its echo lasts a deal longer.

One must be absolutely modern.
Don't be such a pompous ass!
Tell them I've had a wonderful life.
Thales said there was no difference between life and death. "Why, then," said some one to him, "do not you die?" "Because," said he, "it does make no difference."
When Thales was asked what was difficult, he said, "To know one’s self." And what was easy, "To advise another."
Chilo advised not to speak evil of the dead.
Socrates said, "Those who want fewest things are nearest to the gods."
There is a written and an unwritten law. The one by which we regulate our constitutions in our cities is the written law; that which arises from customs is the unwritten law.

They say that the first inclination which an animal has is to protect itself.
If any one were to take away from the books of Chrysippus all the passages which he quotes from other authors, his paper would be left empty.
One of the sophisms of Chrysippus was, "If you have not lost a thing, you have it."

The road up and the road down is one and the same.
The condition of Man is a condition of Warre of every one against every one.
Where there is no common power, there is no law, where no law, no injustice. Force, and fraud, are in war the cardinal virtues.
Whatsoever therefore is consequent to a time of Warre, where every man is Enemy to every man; the same is consequent to the time, wherein men live without other security, than what their own strength, and their own invention shall furnish them withall. In such condition, there is no place for Industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no Navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving, and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continuall feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.
Do not that to another, which thou wouldst not have done to thyself.
True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united.
I am more and more convinced that our happiness or our unhappiness depends far more on the way we meet the events of life than on the nature of those events themselves.
I'm not paranoid, they do follow me!

We are now forming a republican government. Real liberty is neither found in despotism or the extremes of democracy, but in moderate governments.
I won't do that. I'd rather die.
Men are rather reasoning than reasonable animals, for the most part governed by the impulse of passion.
Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.
There is danger from all men. The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty.
There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leader, and concerting measures in opposition to each other. This, in my humble apprehension, is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution.
Our obligations to our country never cease but with our lives.
Man who preys both on the vegetable and animal species, is himself a prey to neither.
If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.
All persons shall have full and free liberty of religious opinion; nor shall any be compelled to frequent or maintain any religious institution.
The basis of our government being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.
There is a time for many words, and there is also a time for sleep.
To even mention all the things the bird must constantly keep in mind in order to fly securely through the air would take a considerable part of the evening... The bird has learned this art of equilibrium, and learned it so thoroughly that its skill is not apparent to our sight. We only learn to appreciate it when we try to imitate it.
For we must consider that we shall be a city upon a hill.
