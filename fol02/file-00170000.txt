Tatoeba is a language dictionary.
You can search words, and get translations. But it's not exactly a typical dictionary.
It's all about sentences. Not words.
You can search sentences containing a certain word and get translations for these sentences.
Why sentences? …you may ask. Well, because sentences are more interesting.
Sentences bring context to the words. Sentences have personalities. They can be funny, smart, silly, insightful, touching, hurtful.
Sentences can teach us a lot. And a lot more than just words.
So we love sentences. But, even more, we love languages.
And what we really want is to have many sentences in many — and any — languages.
This is why Tatoeba is multilingual. But not that kind of multilingual. Not the kind where languages are simply being paired up together, and where some pairs are left behind.
Tatoeba is really multilingual. All the languages are interconnected.
If an Icelandic sentence has a translation in English, and the English sentence has a translation in Swahili, then indirectly, this will provide a Swahili translation for the Icelandic sentence.
Languages that would have never found themselves together in a traditional system, can be connected in Tatoeba.
But where do we get those sentences? And how do we translate them?
Obviously, this cannot be the work of one person. This is why Tatoeba is collaborative.
Everyone is free to contribute.
And everyone has the ability to contribute.
It doesn't require you to be a polyglot.
Everyone speaks a language.
Everyone can feed the database to illustrate new vocabulary.
Everyone can help ensure that sentences sound correct, and are correctly spelled.
And actually, this project needs everyone.
Languages are not carved in stone. Languages live through all of us.
We want to capture all the uniqueness of each language. And we as well want to capture their evolution through time.
But you know, it would be sad to collect all these sentences, and keep them for ourselves. Because there's so much you can do with them. Which is why Tatoeba is open. Our source code is open. Our data is open.
We're releasing all the sentences we collect under the Creative Commons Attribution license.
This means you can reuse them freely for a textbook, for an application, for a research project, for anything!
So that's Tatoeba.
But that's not the whole picture. Tatoeba is not just an open, collaborative, multilingual dictionary of sentences. It's part of an ecosystem that we want to build.
We want to bring language tools to the next level. We want to see innovation in the language learning landscape. And this cannot happen without open language resources which cannot be built without a community which cannot contribute without efficient platforms.
So ultimately, with Tatoeba we are only building the foundations… to make the Web a better place for language learning.

The nature of this language is to be clear, logical and nervous. It won't let itself be weakened, obscured or corrupted.

How much more so for my father, the honourable Mr Jia, who is generous and chivalrous, anxious to help those in difficulty, deals with people’s problems, and helps people marry off their daughters and raise their sons; examples of these cannot be counted on one’s fingers.

Virtual memory is a memory management technique developed for multitasking kernels.
Almost all implementations of virtual memory divide the virtual address space of an application program into pages; a page is a block of contiguous virtual memory addresses.
Pages are usually at least KiB (4×bytes) in size, and systems with large virtual address ranges or large amounts of real memory generally use larger page sizes.
By the debate over virtual memory for commercial computers was over. An IBM research team led by David Sayre showed that their virtual memory overlay system consistently worked better than the best manually controlled systems.
Some systems, such as Burroughs B5500, do not use paging to implement virtual memory. Instead, they use segmentation, that divide virtual address spaces into variable-length segments. A virtual address consists of a segment number and an offset within the segment.

The feelings of "love at first sight" and "faithful unto death" are unrealistic; this sort of unrealistic and illusory feeling is not what we need.
The way some people see it, associating with the opposite sex is just like going to the seaside and gathering stones; everyone can pick up the ones they like.
Once you've picked up a stone that you like, take it home as soon as you can and treat it well, because that's the only stone you've got.
What's more, from now on you must remember that you cannot go to the seaside again (by believing this forever, I have already found the biggest, best and most fitting one for me).
The most important thing about relations with the opposite sex is not how good the other person is, but that they treat you well.
If one person's qualities are really good, and they have one hundred points, but of those hundred they only give you thirty or forty, or even ten or twenty and then inversely, another person maybe only has seventy or eighty points but they treat you with their heart and soul, then which person should you choose?
In fact, each person's qualities are the same.
No matter how good you are, there will always be people who are better than you.
Although you can't make it as "the greatest person", you can still be the best person to your partner.
Every guy can say "although I'm not the greatest man in the world, I am the man who is best to you."
The most important thing in a relationship lies in how good your partner is to you, and not in how good they are themselves.
If someone is already good in and of themselves, however, and treats you sincerely and from the heart, and truly loves you, then you really can entrust your life to them.
Today, women's only consideration in marriage is probably if you love him or not, if he loves you or not, whether he is sincere and heartfelt towards you, whether there will be pressure with him, whether there will be happiness, and not what his possessions are!

The term "qipao" is widely used in Northern China.
In Southern China, the qipao is also known as "changshan".
A qipao in the traditional style is made entirely by hand and requires labour-intensive manual tailoring techniques to enhance and exhibit every unique female form.
With a high, closed collar, figure-hugging cut, and large slits at either side of a straight skirt, the qipao is unique in its ability to communicate both modesty and sensuousness.
The original qipao was wide and loose.
The original qipao covered most of a woman's body, revealing only the head, the hands and the tips of the toes, in order to conceal the figure of the wearer regardless of her age.
The modern version, which is now popularly recognized in China as the standard qipao, was first developed in Shanghai after 1900.
People eagerly sought a more modernised style of dress and transformed the old qipao to suit their tastes.
Slender and form-fitting with a high cut, the new qipao contrasted sharply with the traditional one.
Some days ago I was in another place.
By the 1940s, the qipao came in a wide variety of designs and fabrics, with an equally wide variety of accessories.

With its distinctive Chinese features, the qipao enjoys growing popularity in the international world of high fashion.

The term "hutong", originally meaning "water well", came from the Mongolian language about years ago.
Hutongs are a type of narrow street, most commonly associated with Beijing, China.
The implication was that where there was a well, there were residents.
In Beijing, hutongs are alleys formed by lines of siheyuans, the traditional courtyard residences.

You must answer the question.
She's nice.
One hutong connects with another, siheyuans connect with other siheyuans to form a block, and blocks join with other blocks to form the whole city.
In the Ming Dynasty (early 15th century) the centre of Beijing was the Forbidden City.
Citizens of higher social status were permitted to live closer to the center.
Aristocrats lived to the east and west of the imperial palace.
The large siheyuans of these high-ranking officials and wealthy merchants often featured beautifully carved and painted roof beams and pillars and carefully landscaped gardens.
Farther from the palace and to its north and south were the commoners, merchants, artisans, and laborers.
Their siheyuans were far smaller in scale and simpler in design and decoration, and the hutongs were narrower.
Nearly all siheyuans had their main buildings and gates facing south for better lighting, so a majority of hutongs run from east to west.
Since the mid-20th century, the number of hutongs in Beijing has dropped dramatically as they are demolished to make way for new roads and buildings.
More recently, some hutongs have been designated as protected areas in an attempt to preserve this aspect of Chinese cultural history.

The first day of the first month in the Chinese lunar calendar is Spring Festival, the most important festival for the people of China.
Spring Festival is also known as Chinese New Year.
Celebrating Spring Festival is commonly referred to as 'passing the year'.
If you mention New Year in China, the image that many people will think of is a family gathered around wrapping dumplings together.
Dumplings are essential at the New Year's Eve dinner table.
Especially in northern China, wrapping and eating dumplings has become an important activity for happily spending New Year's Eve in many households.
Sex: the pleasure is momentary, the position ridiculous, and the expense damnable.
Advice is seldom welcome, and those who need it the most, like it the least.
The more one works, the more willing one is to work.
Men, as well as women, are much oftener led by their hearts than by their understandings.
This means that eating dumplings on New Year's eve is a symbol of family reunion.
The custom of eating dumplings on New Year's Eve is related to an ancient Chinese method of measuring time; in ancient China, each day was divided into twelve sections: the beginning of each day was called 'first time', which corresponds to the period from 11pm to 1am.
Arriving at the end of each year (that is, the last day of the lunar calendar) wasn't just a new day taking over from the previous one, but also a new year taking over from the previous one, and this was called 'first exchange'.
In Chinese, 'dumpling' and 'first exchange' are homophones, so they have a rich cultural association.
All of the longing and wishes for good fortune are wrapped up in the fragile skin of the dumplings.

In linguistics, the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis states that there are certain thoughts of an individual in one language that cannot be understood by those who live in another language.
The interdependence of thought and speech makes it clear that languages are not so much a means of expressing truth that has already been established, but a means of discovering truth that was previously unknown. Their diversity is a diversity not of sounds and signs but of ways of looking at the world.

Where do the buses headed out of town leave from?
This year, Edinburgh began work on its fifteen-year regeneration project to transform its waterfront and provide a new kind of living area for its growing population.
What's new about this way of urban living?
Before now, when you thought of a city, you thought of crowded streets, parking problems, traffic jams, queues, noise and fumes.
Cities are exciting places, but also stressful.
The Edinburgh Waterfront project could be about to change all that.
With the creation of a city area that's more like a town, with plenty of greenery and community buildings, living in the city will soon mean simpler, stress-free lifestyles for the 20,that are expected to live, work and play in Edinburgh's Waterfront.
How will the project work?
Over the next fifteen years, architects, planners and community developers will work together to transform acres of industrial wasteland into 6,homes, two shopping centres, a marina, a primary school and college, and parkland.
Trams will link the area to Edinburgh's city centre (which is only two miles away).
What will this mean for Edinburgh?
Edinburgh already offers a busy and traditional city experience, with many historic buildings and tourist attractions.
The Waterfront project will help to keep Edinburgh up-to-date and bring more people to Scotland's capital city.
Fifteen per cent of the housing will be affordable, so that low-income families will be able to buy or rent homes in the area.
It will also help to strengthen the city's economy.
For the UK's fastest growing city after London, this is good news.
So, will this mean healthier cities?
Edinburgh's Waterfront is just one of the many projects that are regenerating UK towns and cities.
The Waterfront's success could mean that other cities soon follow, creating areas that offer people a new kind of city living, with all the benefits and none of the stress, noise and pollution of crowded centres.
Can Edinburgh show us the way towards healthier cities?
Let's hope so.

As figures from the National Development and Reform Committee show, the Internet has developed rapidly in rural China.
By the end of June 2006, the number of netizens in rural China had reached three million, seven hundred and forty one thousand, making up 5.1% of the total rural population.
In the same period, the number of urban netizens in China reached one hundred and twenty five million, making up 21.6% of the total urban population.
By the end of 2006, the number of rural netizens in China was twenty three million one hundred thousand, showing that in six months a total of fourteen million, three hundred thousand rural Chinese got online.
The report from the National Development and Reform Committee says that the advance in rural high-speed telecommunication infrastructure is the main reason for the increase in Internet users.
In its "Eleven Five Plan" (to 2010), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology pledged to implement phone connections in every village and Internet connections in every town.
Young people and migrant workers are the bulk of rural Internet users; in terms of online music, online games, online film and television, and the Internet's capacity for entertainment, rural Internet users are equivalent to urban ones.
However, compared to that in cities, rural use of online news, search engines, online shopping, online banking, online stocks and so on is much lower.
The typical Japanese person doesn't speak English.
In some rural areas, the Internet is important for agricultural information, as well as being particularly useful for the purposes of agricultural production technologies and pricing.
Liu Manqiang, deputy director of the Chinese Research Centre and College for Social Sciences and Information Technology, says "Information and communication technology has the potential for a huge increase in value; an important goal for the development of China's information technology is allowing more rural citizens to benefit from the information technology industry."

This is the second time I have arrived in China on my own.
The first time, I spoke pretty much no Chinese at all, and didn't understand China's conventions and customs.
But when I arrived in China that time, I had a family waiting for me.
This time, although I'm more experienced, there's nobody waiting to meet me.
My final destination in China is the city of Harbin in the north-east, about one thousand kilometres from Beijing.
When booking flights, I decided the easiest way would be to fly to Beijing first, then get the train to complete my journey.
Doing it this way was probably the most fun, too.
However, as soon as I saw the situation at the train station I began to regret this decision.
The queue for buying tickets was unbelievably long.
In China, you have to go to the departure station and buy train tickets there.
What's more, you can only buy train tickets one week in advance.
At the train station, once I had figured out where the queue for tickets actually was, I began the long wait.
I didn't arrive in Harbin until very late, and the queue for taxis was already extremely long.
Not long after I joined the queue, a man approached and asked if I wanted a taxi.
"But I'm already queuing," I tell him.
I am suspicious that this is an illegal taxi.
"You don't have to queue for my car," he offers.
"Is it an illegal taxi?" I ask him.
"Then I don't want it," I reply.
That evening, the university held a meeting for foreign students and Chinese students studying foreign languages.
Without warning, the teachers ask students from each country to take the microphone and explain to everyone their reasons for coming to Harbin.
When it comes to my turn to speak, I confuse the words 'standard' and 'common', and end up saying that the north-eastern accent is 'the most common'.
Fortunately, everybody understood what this foreigner meant, knew I was only making a fool of myself, and laughed at me.
In Harbin, many people invite me to their homes to have dinner.
This laowai, how classy!
