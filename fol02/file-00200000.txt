Tom, stranded alone at the beginning of sentences, couldn't get used to the growing estrangement of Mary.
Tom, alone, bent over the left edge of the sentence, was hesitating to jump, to put an end to all this story.
By dint of pushing the words back to the beginning of the sentence, there only remained the two of them at the end: Mary, Tom.
"Tom! Do you realise that these sentences are very self-centred: They always either begin with or end with you! Even both!" she reproached Tom.
I'd like to finish the work on my own.
Tom, desperate, howled: "Mary! Where are you?" from the very left edge of the sentence. "I fear I'm from now on, fully at the opposite from you" drily retorted Mary.
Tom was quibbling about the sentences concerning him, while Mary was doing her best to translate them.
Money rules the world.

You learn English.
Frustrated at not being the exclusive object of her desires anymore, Tom demoted Mary.
Mary told Tom: "Let's begin with a short sentence, and then we'll see..."
It was through a first short sentence that Tom got acquainted to Mary.
Far from being but the object of their ambiguous relation, Mary was the subject of all Tom's attention.

"Tom!" "Mary?" "Is it possible that we'll ever be closer than in this sentence?"
Tom had just one word to cut so that out of this sentence, forever, disappeared our Mary.
Tired of being the subject of accusations from Tom, Mary fled to France, whose language has no accusative case.
Our two heroes having deserted this sentence, their adventures seemed to be willing to end precisely with this word.
Tom, this lumber, sat at one end of this sentence, while, too light to counterbalance him, on the other side, sat Mary.
Tom and Mary then found themselves side by side at the start of this sentence and undertook to explore it.
Having reached the end of this first sentence, in which the voodoo priestess had summoned them, they saw others and wondered how they could get to them together, inseparable Tom and Mary.
Fate smiled upon me.
In order to cross from one sentence to the other, Tom was stretching out his arm. Mary clung firmly onto it and jumped over the dot, avoiding to fall into the space.

Now it is true that I believe this country is following a dangerous trend when it permits too great a degree of centralization of governmental functions. I oppose this — in some instances the fight is a rather desperate one. But to attain any success it is quite clear that the Federal government cannot avoid or escape responsibilities which the mass of the people firmly believe should be undertaken by it. The political processes of our country are such that if a rule of reason is not applied in this effort, we will lose everything — even to a possible and drastic change in the Constitution. This is what I mean by my constant insistence upon "moderation" in government.
