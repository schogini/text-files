Honesty and truth are essential principles we have been learning since childhood.
Parents and adults punish children when they tell a lie, but it could be argued that often they aren't themselves good examples of sincerity.

A lie said to avoid hurting someone's feelings and expectations is called a "white lie."
Are white lies really necessary in our social life?

White lies could help us to be diplomatic and avoid hard feelings and arguments which can ruin a day - or a friendship.

We would never know that someone hadn't invited us to his party.
In some situations, telling a white lie could be used to avoid people to be disappointed or get angry by or with someone.
Honesty is one of the most beautiful things in the world.
Even if lies and white lies are a spontaneous reaction of our brain, they will never be the truth, the reality of things, the life.
