Maybe you should've said something about this earlier.
You should've just told me earlier.
Does that mean I'm dying?

We were dumbfounded.
That's dumb.
My throat's a little dry.

Will that key unlock this drawer?
I think I have the key to that drawer.
Look in your top drawer.
There's nothing left in the drawer.
Tom closed the drawer.
Do you like to draw?
What conclusions can we draw?
Do you work downtown?
Why don't we go downstairs?
Should I write that down?

Tom didn't care how it got done as long as it got done.
My work here is done.
Tom knows how to get things done.
I don't like what Tom has done.
Tom must pay for what he's done.
Well done.
Now look what you've done.
Now look what I've done.

Tell Tom to do what needs to be done.
You must've already done everything that needs to be done.

What were you really doing?
What are you girls doing?
What are you kids doing?
What are your kids doing?
What did Tom end up doing?
What were you and Tom doing?
What do you think I'm doing?
Is there anything more interesting that we could be doing?
Tom is doing what he enjoys doing.
Tom is doing the same thing Mary is doing.
We can't see what Tom is doing.
We pretended not to see what Tom was doing.
Tom asked Mary what she was doing.
Tom shouldn't have been doing what he was doing.
I was able to do everything I'd planned on doing.
Tom wondered what Mary had been doing.
Tom knows that it's not worth doing.
I didn't do what you're accusing me of doing.
Just go back to what you were doing.
Go back to what you were doing.
Tom didn't feel he should do what the other children were doing.
Look what they're doing.
Tom will want to know how you're doing.

I'm not quite sure what I should be doing.
Are you afraid of dogs?

Did you call the doctor?
Should I call the doctor?
Why did you become a doctor?
Tom went to the doctor.
I went to the doctor.
Tom didn't want to be a lawyer or a doctor.
How did they do?
Does Tom feel the same way about that as you do?
So, what would you do?
What did they ask you to do?
Do you really think that was what Tom wanted you to do?
Have you already done everything I've asked you to do?
What does Tom want to do?
Don't you know what to do?
Could you tell me what to do?
What do you expect us to do?
What was it you asked Tom to do?
What are we trying to do?
What were they going to do?
What else are we going to do?
Did you really think that was what Tom was planning to do?
Is that all you have to do?
Now what do I have to do?
Is this really what you want me to do?
What does Tom want me to do?
Is there something you need for me to do?
What was it you asked me to do?
What do kids like to do?
Did you really think that was what Tom wanted to do?
What are you supposed to do?
How could you not know what you were supposed to do?
So, what do we need to do?
What does this button do?
What else could Tom do?
Have you decided what you'll do?
What good do you think that'll do?
What does that thing do?
What more can I do?
Just do what you usually do.
They're not very good at what they do.
Tom could never make me laugh the way you do.
Be careful what you do.
I like the same things you do.
Your brother looks a lot more like your father than you do.
It would be best if you did everything Tom asks you to do.
That was a stupid thing for you to do.
I'll tell you exactly what I need you to do.
Tom was able to accomplish everything he'd set out to do.
Do what you want to do.
Tom said he had to do some things he didn't want to do.
You haven't asked me what I want to do.
You haven't even asked me what I want to do.
It looks like you don't really know what to do.
It seems like you don't know what to do.
Tom will show you what to do.
Tom didn't know just what to do.
It looks like you've finally decided what to do.
I can't believe this is what Tom really wants us to do.
Let's do what Tom wants us to do.
We had no choice. We had to do what they told us to do.
We had to do what they told us to do.
I guess we should do what Tom asked us to do.
Tom won't let Mary do anything she wants to do.
I have a few things to do.
We have other things to do.
There's nothing better to do.
That was a stupid thing for Tom to do.
Tom didn't feel he could do what Mary was asking him to do.
Tom knew that he wouldn't be able to do what Mary wanted him to do.
Tom readily promised to do what we asked him to do.
Tom did neither of the two things I asked him to do.
Tom wondered what Mary was planning to do.
Tom didn't mention what he was planning to do.
We don't have anything to do.
Tom says he has nothing to do.
It won't be an easy thing to do.
It's the smart thing to do.
Telling me was the right thing to do.
I think it's the right thing to do.
This is what I have to do.
I still can't remember what Tom told me to do.
I've already done everything you've asked me to do.
Tom didn't do anything that he wasn't supposed to do.
Tom couldn't help noticing that there were many people doing things they weren't supposed to do.
Tom couldn't remember what he was supposed to do.
Tom didn't understand what he was supposed to do.
I know that wasn't what I was supposed to do.
Make sure Tom knows what he's supposed to do.
I still can't remember what I'm supposed to do.
Just do what you're supposed to do.
Tom didn't see how he could manage to do everything he'd been asked to do.
There's a lot that we still need to do.
I've been thinking about what we need to do.
I have something else I need to do.
Tom tried to tell Mary what she needed to do.
Tom didn't say what else he had to do.
I only did what I had to do.
Tom had an important job to do.
It's all you really can do.
You just have to wait. There's nothing else you can do.
It's the least we can do.
I don't see what we can do.
Look what I can do.
For now, that's the only thing I can do.
Tell me what you'll do.
Yeah, that's what I'll do.
That'll be the next thing we do.
Look what you made me do.
Tom is sure to know what we should do.
Tom will know what we should do.
I have no idea what I should do.
Tom didn't know what he'd do.
Yeah, that's what I'd do.
Tom spends less time studying French than I do.
Tom wondered if Mary knew John and Alice were planning on getting divorced.
Tom still doesn't know that Mary and I are divorced.
Tom doesn't know it yet, but Mary plans to ask him for a divorce.
I can't jump over that ditch.
Tom just told me something very disturbing.
Sorry, I was distracted.
I heard a siren in the distance.
I was quite dissatisfied.
Tom is washing the dishes.
I washed the dishes.
Don't you think that's a bit disgusting?
That's really disgusting.
It's disgusting.
It's a bad disease.
What are you discussing?
Is there anything you want to discuss?
I don't know what else there is to discuss.
We have other things to discuss.
We have other things we need to discuss.
Let's not get discouraged.
Tom is discouraged.
I'm not a disbeliever.
I've had too many disappointments.
It was a huge disappointment.
I was very disappointed.
Hopefully, no one will be disappointed.
You have to disappear.
Who became the new director?
Tom didn't answer the question directly.
All I want is directions.
Tom looked in the wrong direction.
Didn't you see Tom at dinner?
Do you want to stay for dinner?
Is it almost time for dinner?
Why aren't you cooking dinner?
Thank you for the delicious dinner.
We're ready for dinner.
It's almost time for dinner.
You're invited to dinner.
Tom made dinner.
I've made dinner.
I know you'll enjoy the food at Chuck's Diner.
The exam was very difficult.
Getting started is always difficult.
The exam was difficult.
It's all so difficult.
I know it'll be difficult.
That's different.
With Tom, it would've been different.
If Tom had been there, it would've been different.
Wow, you look different.
We were expecting something different.
Try eating something different.
Has someone died?
It was here that Tom died.
Without you, I would've died.
Aren't you afraid to die?
Do you think Tom will die?
You'll remember that until you die.
Love doesn't die.
Do you know what I just did?
Do you really know what Tom did?
Did you hear what Tom did?
Tom couldn't remember, but Mary did.
Tom didn't choose the same thing Mary did.
Tom didn't care who helped him, as long as somebody did.
Think about what you did.
Look what you did.
I'm awfully glad you showed up when you did.
Tom couldn't have said it any better than you did.
Tom would've done the same thing you did.
I recently learned about what Tom did.
It takes great courage to do what Tom did.
I saw what your dog did.
Tom promised not to tell anyone about what we did.
Maybe we should blame Tom for what we did.
We did the same thing as everybody else did.
Tom wondered what had made Mary do what she did.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as I thought he did.
Tom didn't say what he did.
I didn't do what you think I did.
I want this dictionary.
Tom shouldn't have told Mary where he hid the diamonds.
Do you have diabetes?
Could you give us more details?
Tom wouldn't give me any details.
Tom wanted to hear every detail.
I don't have enough space in my room for that desk.
Everyone gets what they deserve.
It's what we deserve.
Tom's story was very depressing.
This is depressing.
I'm very depressed.
When it rains, I get depressed.
Tom is afraid to go to the dentist.
Here's a list of our demands.
Where's the package you wanted me to deliver?
This peanut butter is delicious.
It sounds delicious.
They're delicious.
This is really delicate.
The train has been delayed.
It looks like a deer.
Is the well deep?
Have you already started to decorate?
Why do I have to be the one who makes this decision?
We'll make the right decision.
I hope we've made the right decision.
I made the right decision.
I think it's a fair decision.
I've just made a decision.
Have you finally decided?
It looks like you've finally decided.
Why do I have to decide?
I don't have any debt.

Tom was half beaten to death.
I hope we don't starve to death.
You look like death.
Tom doesn't talk a great deal.
It was a huge deal.
Tom wondered what it would be like to be deaf.
Are you sure Tom is dead?
I'm not sure, but perhaps Tom is already dead.
I'm glad Tom isn't dead.
Tom and Mary are both dead.
Both my parents are dead.
Apparently, they're dead.
Everyone thinks you're dead.
You should pretend to be dead.
Do you really want to stay for another three days?
Tom remained in Boston for a few days.
I'm happy these days.
You'll understand why one of these days.
Wait a few more days.
Tom postponed his departure for three days.
I'll be gone for three days.
How did you spend your day?
Did you sleep all day?
Did you have a good day?
You should try to learn something new every day.

Tom knew that he'd be very hungry by the end of the day.
There's nothing better than a good cup of coffee to start off the day.
Today wasn't a good day.
What a lousy day!
Is this your daughter?
What happened to your daughter?
You're too young to be dating.
Did Tom ask you on a date?
This is the place where your mother and I had our first date.
Have a good time on your date.
I don't trust this data.
Can cats really see in the dark?
Some women are very dangerous.
Tonight, let's all go dancing.
I don't like square dancing.
I knew Tom wouldn't like the way Mary danced.
Would you care to dance?
I don't know how to dance.
I just want to dance.
Tom didn't go to the dance.
Tom can both sing and dance.
Do you think I'm cynical?
I thought it was cute.
I thought what Tom did was cute.
Go get your hair cut.
What's in that cupboard?
I love this cup.
Tom put down his spoon and picked up his cup.
I filled the cup.
Tom wondered what had made Mary start crying.
Tom wondered why Mary was crying.
It sounds like someone's crying.
Tom fell asleep crying.
Tom didn't cry.
Tom looks like he's about ready to cry.
I almost started to cry.
It's OK to cry.
The movie made me cry.
We met on a cruise.
I hate crowds.
Tom likes to avoid large crowds.
Do you know how to crochet?
Your advice is critical.
It made me cringe.
I think they're all criminals.
They're criminals.

Why are you sad, my Queen?
You should not mope all day in your rooms, but should come out into the green garden, and hear the birds sing with joy among the trees, and see the butterflies fluttering above the flowers, and hear the bees and insects hum, and watch the sunbeams chase the dew-drops through the rose-leaves and in the lily-cups.
What harm would it do if I were to go into the garden for a short time and enjoy myself among the trees and flowers, and the singing birds and fluttering butterflies and humming insects, and look at the dew-drops hiding from the sunbeams in the hearts of the roses and lilies, and wander about in the sunshine, instead of remaining all day in this room?
She had no idea that the kind-looking old woman leaning on her crutch was in reality a wicked witch, who envied the Queen her good fortune, and was determined to ruin her.
The day is so warm, and the sun’s rays so scorching, that the water in the pond looks very cool and inviting. Would you not like to bathe in it, fair Queen?
"No, I think not," answered the Queen.
Why shouldn’t I bathe in that cool, fresh water? No harm could come of it. And, so saying, she slipped off her robes and stepped into the water.
The wicked witch pushed her into the deep water.
The witch assumed the form of the Queen, and decked herself out in the royal robes, and sat among the Court ladies, awaiting the King’s return.
She threw her arms around her husband’s neck and kissed him.
The witch hastened forward to meet the royal carriages, and, throwing her arms round the King’s neck, kissed him.
The King did not know that the woman he held in his arms was not his own dear wife, but a wicked witch.
In the meantime, outside the palace walls, the poor White Duck swam up and down the pond.
The duck laid three eggs, out of which there came one morning two little fluffy ducklings and a little ugly drake.
But the young ones did not listen to their mother, and, playing about the garden one day, they strayed close up to the castle windows.
The witch told the servants to sharpen the knives, and to make a great fire ready, and hang a large kettle full of water over it.
The two little ducklings had fallen asleep, and the little drake lay between them, covered up by their wings, to be kept warm under their feathers.
"They are not asleep yet," muttered the witch to herself.
The next morning the White Duck wandered round the pond, looking for her little ones; she called and she searched, but could find no trace of them.
The witch told the servants to sharpen the knives, make a great fire ready, and hang a large kettle full of water over it.
Chase that duck out of the courtyard.
Catch that duck and bring it here.
As the king stroked her wings she was changed into a beautiful woman, and he recognised his dear wife.
The King and Queen were overjoyed when they saw their children, and they all lived happily together in the beautiful palace.
There were once a King and a Queen, and they had a son called Sigurd, who was very strong and active, and good-looking.
Odette fell in love with Prince Siegfried.
The lovers drowned themselves in the lake and were reunited forever in death.
The king spoke to his son and told him that he would like to see him married before he died.
He and the Princess loved each other dearly, and after a year a son came to them.

They wanted to upscale their industrial power.
The queen saw something black on the sea, which seemed to be coming nearer.
At last the boat came alongside the ship, and now the queen saw that it was a stone boat, out of which there came up on board the ship a fearfully ugly witch.
The queen was more frightened than words can describe, and could neither speak a word nor move from the place so as to awaken the King or the sailors.
The witch stripped her of all her fine clothes, which she proceeded to put on herself.
In the court, there were two young fellows, one of eighteen years old, the other of nineteen, who were very fond of playing chess.
The king and queen embraced each other, and she told him the whole story.
The King now understood how the Queen he had had for some time past had been so ill-tempered. He at once had a sack drawn over her head and made her be stoned to death, and after that torn in pieces by untamed horses.
The real queen was now restored to all her dignity, and was beloved by all.

There's a moat around the castle.
The archeologists found the bones of an ancient dragon.
For some years the poor man lived on alone with the children, caring for them as best he could; but everything in the house seemed to go wrong without a woman to look after it, and at last he made up his mind to marry again, feeling that a wife would bring peace and order to his household and take care of his motherless children.
Everything in the house seemed to go wrong without a woman to look after it.
At last, he made up his mind to marry again, feeling that a wife would bring peace and order to his household and take care of the children.
Barbary lions are extinct.
The step-mother was very cruel to the twins, and beat them, and half-starved them, and constantly drove them out of the house.
All day she thought of nothing but how she should get rid of the twins; and at last an evil idea came into her head, and she determined to send them out into the great gloomy wood where a wicked witch lived.
You have been such good children that I am going to send you to visit my granny, who lives in a dear little hut in the wood.
So the children left the house together; and the little sister, who was very wise for her years, said to the brother: "We will first go and see our own dear grandmother, and tell her where our step-mother is sending us."
You poor motherless children! How I pity you; and yet I can do nothing to help you!
Your step-mother is not sending you to her granny, but to a wicked witch who lives in that great gloomy wood.
Now listen to me, children. You must be civil and kind to everyone, and never say a cross word to anyone, and never touch a crumb belonging to anyone else.
She gave her grandchildren a bottle of milk and a piece of ham and a loaf of bread, and they set out for the great gloomy wood.
They were so terrified that they hid behind one another, and said: "Good-morning, granny; our step-mother has sent us to wait upon you, and serve you."
If I am pleased with you, I’ll reward you; but if I am not, I’ll put you in a pan and fry you in the oven.
She gave the boy a sieve in which to carry water from the well.
From every hole and corner in the hut mice came pattering along the floor, squeaking and saying: "Little girl, why are your eyes so red? If you want help, then give us some bread."
When they entered the hut the cat was curled up on the floor. So they stroked her, and fed her with ham, and said to her: "Pussy-cat, grey pussy-cat, tell us how we are to get away from the witch?"
The cat thanked them for the ham, and gave them a pocket-handkerchief and a comb.
The cat had scarcely finished speaking when the witch returned to see if the children had fulfilled their tasks.
"Well, you have done well enough for today," she grumbled; "but tomorrow you’ll have something more difficult to do, and if you don’t do it well, you pampered brats, straight into the oven you go."
Half-dead with fright, and trembling in every limb, the poor children lay down to sleep on a heap of straw in the corner of the hut.
The princess was thrown into the castle's deepest dungeon.
In the morning, the witch gave the girl two pieces of linen to weave before night, and the boy a pile of wood to cut into chips.
First they met the watch-dog, who was going to leap on them and tear them to pieces; but they threw the remains of their bread to him, and he ate them and wagged his tail.
Then they were hindered by the birch-trees, whose branches almost put their eyes out. But the little sister tied the twigs together with a piece of ribbon, and they got past safely.
I have served you all these years and you never even threw me a bone, but the dear children gave me their own piece of ham.
I have served you all these years and you never gave me so much as a hard crust, but the dear children gave me their own loaf of bread.
When the witch saw that the children had escaped her, she was furious, and, hitting the cat with a porringer, she said: "Why did you let the children leave the hut? Why did you not scratch their eyes out?"
The witch saw there was no help to be got from her old servants, and that the best thing she could do was to mount on her broom and set off in pursuit of the children.
As the children ran, they heard the sound of the broom sweeping the ground close behind them.
They told their father all that they had suffered, and he was so angry with their step-mother that he drove her out of the house, and never let her return; but he and the children lived happily together; and he took care of them himself, and never let a stranger come near them.
A soldier came marching along the high road—left, right! A left, right! He had his knapsack on his back and a sword by his side, for he had been to the wars and was now returning home.
A soldier came marching along the high road. He had his knapsack on his back and a sword by his side, for he had been to the wars and was now returning home.
An old Witch met him on the road. She was very ugly to look at: her under-lip hung down to her breast.
"Do you see that great tree there?" said the witch, pointing to a tree beside them.
I will tie a rope round your waist, so that I may be able to pull you up again when you call.
For me, you shall bring nothing but an old tinder-box which my grandmother forgot last time she was down there.
The Soldier climbed up the tree, let himself down through the hole, and found himself standing, as the Witch had said, underground in the large hall, where the three hundred lamps were burning.
Tell me at once what you want to do with the tinder-box, or I will draw my sword, and cut off your head!
The soldier immediately cut off her head.
He turned into the finest inn, ordered the best chamber and his favourite dinner; for now that he had so much money he was really rich.
The queen failed to produce a male heir for the king.
It's an incredibly moving story.
The princess lives in a great copper castle, surrounded by many walls and towers! No one except the King may go in or out, for it is prophesied that she will marry a common soldier, and the King cannot submit to that.
Now he was rich, wore fine clothes, and made many friends, who all said that he was an excellent man, a real nobleman.
But as he was always spending money, and never made any more, at last the day came when he had nothing left but two shillings, and he had to leave the beautiful rooms in which he had been living, and go into a little attic under the roof, and clean his own boots, and mend them with a darning-needle.
But as he was always spending money, and never made any more, at last the day came when he had nothing left but two shillings.
None of his friends came to visit him there, for there were too many stairs to climb.
Anne Boleyn was the first queen to be executed at the Tower of London.
It is very strange that no one can get to see the Princess. They all say she is very pretty, but what’s the use of that if she has to sit forever in the great copper castle with all the towers? Can I not manage to see her somehow?
She was so beautiful that anyone could see that she was a real Princess.
The soldier really could not refrain from kissing her.
The queen was an extremely clever woman, who could do a great deal more than just drive in a coach.
They told him: "Tomorrow you are to be hanged." Hearing that did not exactly cheer him.
Next morning, he could see through the iron grating in front of his little window how the people were hurrying out of the town to see him hanged.
Outside the town a great scaffold had been erected, and all round were standing the soldiers, and hundreds of thousands of people. The King and Queen were sitting on a magnificent throne opposite the judges and the whole council.
The Princess came out of the copper castle, and became Queen; and that pleased her very much.
The wedding festivities lasted for eight days.
