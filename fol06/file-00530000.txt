Giovanni Cassini (1625-1712) was the first to observe four of Saturn’s moons, including Iapetus.
As the warm days of spring led to summer, a baby bat was born. He had a tiny, furry body with awkward wings. His mother held him close to her and wrapped him in her wings.
His mother called him "Echo."
A bat's legs are made up of light weight bones. This bone structure is good for flying and hanging upside down.
"I am taking you with me so I can catch some insects for breakfast," Mother Bat explained. "Flying insects are food for us bats."
They huddled close together to stay warm.
"Oh, why doesn't she hear me," Echo thought to himself.
Echo was very happy that his mother had returned.
"It is now time for you to learn to fly," said Echo's mother.
"Look at me," shouted Echo, "Look at me, Mother, I'm flying!"
"Follow me!" Echo's mother called out. "Let's find some yummy beetles for breakfast."
All the young bats were happy to be flying. They flew around the lake and through the pine trees.
Echo was getting tired and hungry. It takes a lot of energy for a bat to fly.
Back at their home in the pine tree, Echo's mother told him a story.
"Soon it will get colder," said Mother Bat. "We will fly south where it is warmer and stay there all winter. This is what it means to migrate. We will travel to a cave where we will meet other bats. This is a wonderful time for us."
Echo fell asleep next to his mother dreaming of the bat cave.
The five human senses are sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch.
Bat biologists found Echo, a Big Brown Bat (Eptesicus fuscus) near Roosevelt Lake southwest of the fire. They attached a tag to his wing for identification before releasing him.

On August 31, 1950, another V-was launched and carried an unanaesthetized mouse that was photographed in flight and did not survive impact.
On December 12, 1949, the last V-monkey flight was launched at White Sands. Albert IV, a rhesus monkey attached to monitoring instruments, was the payload. It was a successful flight, with no ill effects on the monkey until impact, when it died.
On September 20, 1951, a monkey named Yorick and mice were recovered after an Aerobee missile flight of 236,feet at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. Yorick got a fair amount of press as the first monkey to live through a space flight.

He died on splashdown when a flotation mechanism failed, but Navy doctors said signals on his respiration and heartbeat proved humans could withstand a similar trip.

Where is the closest hospital?
Where did you spend your summer?
I called from Tom's house.
Why don't you answer me at all?
I am glad you are here.
He has children.
My parents came to see me off at the airport.
They decided to get married the next month.
That's my responsibility.
Tom kissed Mary gently on the lips.
That woman gets shy easily.
Tom was honest about the problem.

Sam, a rhesus monkey, was one of the most well known monkeys of the space program. His name was an acronym for the U.S. Air Force School of Aviation Medicine at Brooks Air Force Base, Texas. He was launched on December 4, 1959, housed in a cylindrical capsule within the Mercury spacecraft atop a Little Joe rocket in order to test the launch escape system (LES). Approximately one minute into the flight, travelling at a speed of mph, the Mercury capsule aborted from the Little Joe launch vehicle. After attaining an altitude of miles, the spacecraft landed safely in the Atlantic Ocean. Sam was recovered, several hours later, with no ill effects from his journey.
On December 22, 1960, soviet scientists attempted to launch Damka ("Little Lady") and Krasavka ("Beauty") on a Korabl Sputnik. However, the upper rocket stage failed and the launch was aborted. The dogs were safely recovered after their unplanned suborbital flight.
Enos became the first chimp to orbit the earth on November 29, 1961, aboard a Mercury Atlas rocket. Although the mission plan originally called for three orbits, due to a malfunctioning thruster and other technical difficulties, flight controllers were forced to terminate Enos' flight after two orbits. Enos landed in the recovery area and was picked up minutes after splashdown. He was found to be in good overall condition.
On October 18, 1963, French scientists launched the first cat into space on a Veronique AGI sounding rocket No. 47. The cat, named Félicette, was successfully retrieved after a parachute descent.
As the warm days of spring led to summer, a baby bat was born.
He had a tiny, furry body with awkward wings.
His mother held him close to her and wrapped him in her wings.
Back in the Soviet Union, the dogs Veterok ("Breeze") and Ugolyok ("Little Lump Of Coal") were launched aboard Kosmos by the Soviet Union on February 22, 1966.
The capsule splashed down in the Indian Ocean and was successfully recovered, but a failure of the reentry guidance system subjected the biological specimens to a ballistic 20G reentry.
Over the past years, American and Soviet scientists have utilized the animal world for testing.
Without animal testing in the early days of the human space program, the Soviet and American programs could have suffered great losses of human life.
These animals performed a service to their respective countries that no human could or would have performed. They gave their lives and/or their service in the name of technological advancement, paving the way for humanity's many forays into space.
Our solar system is elliptical in shape. That means it is shaped like an egg.
The Sun is in the center of the solar system.
Our solar system is always in motion.
Eight known planets and their moons, along with comets, asteroids, and other space objects orbit the Sun.
In 2006, astronomers re-classified Pluto as a dwarf planet.
Pluto has a very unusual orbit. Once every Earth years, Pluto swings inside the orbit of Neptune. It stays there for twenty years. During those twenty years, Pluto is closer to the Sun than Neptune.
Pluto has more in common with Triton, Neptune's largest moon, than it does with any of the eight planets in our solar system. Pluto is actually smaller than Triton.
Pluto is tilted 122.degrees on its axis, which basically means that it is rotating on its head!
The Sun is the biggest object in our solar system. It contains more than 99% of the solar system's mass.
Astronomers think that the solar system is more than billion years old.
Pluto, which was once called a planet, is now called a dwarf planet.
The words " solar system" refer to the Sun and all of the objects that travel around it. These objects include planets, natural satellites such as the Moon, the asteroid belt, comets, and meteoroids.
Our solar system has an elliptical shape and is part of a galaxy known as the Milky Way.
The Sun contains 99.8% of all of the mass in our solar system.
Some astronomers believe the whole solar system formed from a single flat cloud of gas, while others believe it formed when a huge object passed near the Sun, pulling a stream of gas off of the Sun. Astronomers theorize the planets then formed from this gas stream.
A planet is a large space body which reflects the light of a star around which it revolves.
The planets in our solar system are classified as inner planets and outer planets.
The inner planets, the closest to the Sun, are solid spheres of rock and include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
The outer planets are large gaseous spheres with rings and include Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
Between the inner and outer planets is an asteroid belt.
Every planet, except for Earth, was named for an ancient Roman god or goddess.
The temperature on Mercury gets so hot it could melt a tin pan.
After much debate, it was decided that to be a planet in our solar system, an object must be in orbit around the Sun, have enough mass so that it has become round in shape due to its own gravity, and have cleared out its orbital path around the Sun.
Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system.
Mercury travels around the Sun faster than any other planet. That is how it got its name. It was named after Mercury, the swift messenger of the gods in ancient Roman mythology.
Mercury can only be seen from Earth just before sunrise or just after sunset, but not in the middle of the night. That is because Mercury always appears near the Sun when viewed from Earth.
Mercury has a very thin atmosphere.
Mercury is only about one-third the size of the Earth. It is smaller than any other planet.
Mercury is very close to the Sun and has no substantial atmosphere.
Mercury has the greatest temperature range of any planet or natural satellite in our solar system.
The surface temperature on the side of Mercury closest to the Sun reaches degrees Celsius, a temperature hot enough to melt tin. On the side facing away from the Sun, or the night side, the temperature drops to -degrees Celsius.
Scientists have detected a magnetic field surrounding Mercury, though it is not as strong as the field around the Earth.
Mercury's atmosphere is very thin and is composed of helium and sodium.
The surface of Mercury has been shaped by three processes: impact cratering where large objects struck the surface resulting in crater formation, volcanism where lava flooded the surface, and tectonic activity where the planet's crust moved in order to adjust to the planetary cooling and contracting.
Venus is called the Evening Star. It is called this because it looks so bright to us from Earth.
Venus and Earth are almost the same size.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
Venus gets so hot during the day that it could melt a lead cannonball. The temperature rises to degrees Celsius on the side facing the Sun.
Venus has very thick, rapidly spinning clouds which cover its surface.
Venus is unusual because it rotates in a direction opposite that of all of the other planets.
The thick clouds which cover Venus cause a "greenhouse effect". The clouds prevent heat from leaving the atmosphere.
Venus is referred to as the Evening Star because it is the brightest planet that can be viewed from Earth. Its thick cloud cover is an excellent reflector of the Sun's light.
Venus' dense atmosphere is composed of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid which acts as a greenhouse and traps the heat.
Venus revolves around the Sun in a circular orbit once every Earth days.
Venus rotates slowly on its axis in a clockwise direction, which is referred to as a "retrograde" rotation because it is the opposite of the seven other planets.
A Venusian day is longer than a Venusian year.
Venus does not have any naturally occurring satellites.
Even though Mercury is the planet closest to the Sun, Venus is the hottest planet due to the tremendous greenhouse effect caused by the gases in its atmosphere.
Venus has a retrograde rotation which means it rotates on its axis in the opposite direction from the Earth's rotation. This causes the Sun to rise in the west and move eastward across the sky.
We live on the planet Earth.
Earth is the third closest planet to the Sun.
The Earth orbits around the Sun. It takes one year to go around the Sun one complete time.
The Earth also rotates, or spins, on its axis. It takes one day to spin around one complete time.
The Earth's axis is not straight up and down, but tilted a little bit. This tilt is responsible for us having seasons. Otherwise, the temperature would be pretty much the same all year long.
Earth is the only inner planet in our solar system that has liquid water on its surface.
The Earth's atmosphere contains water vapor which helps to moderate our daily temperatures.
Our atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is necessary for us to breathe, 78% nitrogen, and 0.9% argon. The other 0.1% consists of water vapor, carbon dioxide, neon, methane, krypton, helium, xenon, hydrogen, nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone.
The atmosphere protects us from meteors.
Due to the friction generated between a meteor and the atmospheric gases, most meteors burn up before hitting Earth's surface as a meteorite.
The Earth rotates on an imaginary axis which is tilted at a 23.degree angle.
Earth has a core of molten iron-nickel.
The rapid spin of the Earth along with the liquid, hot metallic core causes a magnetic field to surround the Earth.
The Earth's magnetic field traps the charged particles which are hurled at the Earth by the Sun during solar wind activity. When these charged particles react with the gases in our atmosphere, the gases begin to glow. These aurorae, or glowing gases, are seen in the Arctic Circle and the Antarctic Circle.
Earth has one naturally occurring satellite, the Moon.
The rapid spin of the Earth along with the molten metallic core produces the Earth's magnetic field.
If the Earth was any closer to the Sun, it would be too hot to support life. If the Earth was any farther away from the Sun, it would be too cold to support life.
Some of the meteorites found on Earth are actually pieces of the planet Mars. As of June 2006, thirty-four "Martian meteorites" have been found.
During the Martian winter, ice caps can be seen at the poles.
The temperature on Mars can be very, very cold.
Space probes have landed on Mars.
Mars has some of the tallest volcanoes and some of the deepest valleys in our solar system.
Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which have unusual shapes. Scientists think these potato-shaped moons were once asteroids captured by Mars' gravitational pull.
Small rovers landed on Mars and found evidence that long ago water flowed freely on the Martian surface.
Mars is covered by a dirt which has a lot of iron. The iron makes the planet look red.
The orbit of Mars around the Sun is extremely elliptical.
Because the distance between the Sun and Mars varies, temperatures range from -degrees Celsius in the Martian winter to degrees Celsius in the Martian summer.
The Martian atmosphere is composed of over 95% carbon dioxide. Solar winds carry the thin, weak atmosphere away because Mars has a weak gravitational and magnetic field.
At the Martian poles are polar ice caps which shrink in size during the Martian spring and summer.
From data gathered by the Viking and probes, we know that the Martian surface is covered by various rocks and a soil which is rich in an iron-laden clay. The presence of iron explains the planet's reddish-orange appearance.
Mars contains highlands which occur in the southern hemisphere.
Mars also contains lowlands which are found in the northern hemisphere.
The extremely weak magnetic field of Mars suggests that its iron core is no longer fluid and circulating.
The surface of Mars has not only been affected by meteorite impacts, but also by volcanic and tectonic activity.
Mars has some of the largest volcanoes in the solar system; Olympus Mons is over kilometers wide and kilometers high!
Tectonic activity is in evidence at the tremendous Valles Marineris canyon system, which is over kilometers deep and kilometers long.
Mars has two small natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos. They are highly irregular in shape and are believed to be asteroids captured by Mars' weak gravitational field.
Many landforms on Mars appear to have been shaped by flowing water.
The reddish appearance of Mars is believed to be caused by an iron-rich soil.
Jupiter is a large gas planet whose clouds change colors daily.
Jupiter is so large that all of the other planets in the solar system could fit inside of it.
Jupiter is made mostly of hydrogen and helium gases.
Huge areas of swirling gases can be found in Jupiter's atmosphere. The largest swirling area of gas is called the Great Red Spot. Scientists believe this is a large hurricane-like storm which has lasted for hundreds of years.
Large bolts of lightning have been seen in Jupiter's atmosphere.
Pictures taken by space probes have shown thin rings around Jupiter.
As of January 2011, Jupiter has named moons. more have been discovered but not given official status or names.
Can you take us there?
One of Jupiter's moons, Io, has active volcanoes on it.
In July of 1994, Jupiter was hit by pieces of the Shoemaker-Levy comet. Dark areas appeared in Jupiter's atmosphere after the large pieces hit the planet.
Astronomers think the Great Red Spot is a large hurricane-like storm in Jupiter's atmosphere.
Jupiter's rapid rotation causes the planet to flatten at the poles and bulge at the equator.
Jupiter emits twice as much heat as it absorbs from the Sun, which indicates it has its own internal heat source.
Astronomers estimate Jupiter's core temperature at 20,degrees Celsius, approximately three times greater than the temperature of the Earth's core.
Jupiter's powerful magnetic field is thought to be generated by the electric currents produced by pressurized hydrogen in the mantle.
Jupiter's atmosphere is thought to be composed of hydrogen, helium, sulfur, and nitrogen. Clouds in the atmosphere move in alternating bands from east to west or west to east.
Voyager has confirmed that Jupiter is surrounded by a system of thin rings.
For over three hundred years, the Great Red Spot has been observed on Jupiter.
Astronomers believe the Great Red Spot is caused by a potent hurricane-like storm system in Jupiter's atmosphere.
When seen through a telescope, Saturn is one of the most beautiful sights in the night sky.
Saturn is a very large gas planet which spins very rapidly on its axis.
Saturn's atmosphere has winds which can blow at over kilometers per hour.
The white spots on Saturn are believed to be powerful storms.
Saturn is surrounded by over rings made of ice and dust. Some of the rings are very thin and some are very thick. The size of the particles in the rings range from pebble-size to house-size.
Scientists believe that the particles in Saturn's rings came from the destruction of moons circling the planet. As comets and meteorites smashed the moons, Saturn's gravitational pull shaped the particles into rings.
Saturn has at least moons. Some of these moons orbit the planet within the rings, creating gaps in the rings.
The rings around Saturn are made up of dust and ice.
Saturn has the lowest density of any planet in our solar system. Its density is so low that it would float if it was placed in water.
Just like Jupiter, Saturn emits twice as much heat as it absorbs from the Sun indicating it also has an internal heat source.
Saturn has an extensive ring system which is formed by a thousand individual rings.
The thickness of Saturn's rings ranges from to meters and the rings vary in brightness.
Astronomers believe Saturn's rings developed from particles that resulted from the break-up of naturally occurring satellites.
The particles in the rings closer to the planet orbit the planet at a faster speed than the particles in the rings farther from the planet.
Uranus is one of the smaller gas giants in our solar system, but it is still large enough to hold planets the size of Earth.
When William Herschel discovered Uranus, he at first thought he had discovered a comet.
Cold methane gas is responsible for the blue-green color of Uranus.
Uranus tilts over so far on its axis that it rotates on its side. Because of this, its poles are sometimes pointed almost directly at the Sun.
Uranus' atmosphere is made up of hydrogen, helium, and methane.
The rapid rotation of Uranus causes winds up to kilometers per hour to blow in its atmosphere.
Uranus has eleven known rings, which contain dark, boulder-sized particles.
Uranus has named moons. Some of these moons are less than kilometers wide and black as coal.
Uranus is a large, plain, blue-green planet which can only be seen from the Earth with the unaided eye on a clear, dark night.
Uranus is unique in our solar system because it is tilted degrees. When viewed from Earth, it appears to rotate on its side!

The temperature in Uranus' upper atmosphere is so cold that the methane condenses and forms a thin cloud layer which gives the planet its blue-green appearance.
Uranus has known natural satellites.
Uranus is so far from the Sun that it receives only 0.3% of the sunlight that the Earth does.
Neptune and Uranus are very much alike. They are both large gas planets that look like big blue-green balls in the sky.
Neptune has winds in its atmosphere which blow at over kilometers per hour!
Neptune has large, dark circles on its surface which astronomers believe to be storms.
Neptune has two thick and two thin rings which surround it.
Neptune has thirteen known moons.
One of Neptune's moons, Triton, orbits the planet in a direction opposite to Neptune's other moons.
Not only does Triton orbit Neptune in a direction opposite the other moons, but it is made of rock and ice. This is very different from Neptune's other moons.
Neptune was discovered because Uranus did not follow the orbital path predicted by astronomers. Astronomers assumed that the gravitational pull of another object was affecting the orbit of Uranus. This led them to look for, and find, Neptune.
Voyager 2, a space probe, passed within kilometers of Neptune in 1989.
Uranus and Neptune are very similar in composition.
Neptune has a mantle of liquid hydrogen while the atmosphere is a combination of ammonia, helium, and methane. In the upper atmosphere, methane freezes and forms an ice cloud which casts a shadow on the clouds below.
Neptune has large, dark ovals on its surface which astronomers believe are hurricane-like storms.
Neptune generates more heat than it absorbs from the Sun, indicating it has its own internal heat source.
Neptune has a very strong magnetic field.
Due to Triton's retrograde orbit, its density, and its composition, astronomers theorize that Triton was not originally a satellite of Neptune, but was captured by Neptune's gravitational pull, forcing it into an orbit around the planet.
Triton is thought to be a combination of rock and ice. Its surface temperature is -degrees Celsius, and it has a thin atmosphere of nitrogen and methane.
Voyager produced images showing the Great Dark Spot, a storm on Neptune, as it approached the planet in 1989. By the time the Hubble Space Telescope photographed Neptune in 1994, the spot had disappeared.
When Ceres was first discovered it was called a comet. Within a year it was called a planet. Within one more year it was called an asteroid. Since 2006, it has been called a dwarf planet.
Ceres was discovered on January 1, by Italian Giuseppe Piazzi. He discovered it while searching for a star.
Italian Giuseppe Piazzi discovered Ceres on January 1, while he was searching for a star. He first believed that he had discovered a comet, but he was not confident in his belief.
It takes approximately 4.Earth years for Ceres to make one revolution around the Sun.
Nothing can move through space faster than light.
Einstein discovered that space and time are just two different aspects of spacetime.
Ceres is located million kilometers from the Sun and revolves around the Sun in an orbit between Mars and Jupiter.
Because Ceres is spherical, it is unlike the majority of the members of the asteroid belt.
It is now believed that Ceres formed 4.billion years ago when the solar system was forming.
Ceres contains one-third of the mass found in the asteroid belt.
Scientists believe that Ceres has a rocky core and an icy mantle.
NASA has launched a probe called Dawn, whose mission is to travel to the asteroid belt. It will first travel to observe the asteroid Vesta. After collecting data from Vesta, Dawn will intercept with Ceres where it will observe its surface features and collect data about its chemical composition.
Ceres is named after the Roman goddess of growing plants, harvest, and motherly love.
Eris is the largest known dwarf planet in our solar system. It is a little larger than Pluto.
Eris is about kilometers wide.
Eris was first found by a team of astronomers at Palomar Observatory in California.
Eris is the most distant member of our solar system known at this time. It is times farther out than Pluto.
Eris was named after the goddess of strife. Its moon, Dysnomia, was named after the daughter of Eris.
Eris, the largest known dwarf planet, was first detected in data collected in October of 2003.
It's not possible to travel backward in time.
It takes Earth years for Eris to make one orbit around the Sun.
Eris has a highly eccentric orbit around the Sun, which causes its surface temperature to vary from -degrees Celsius to -degrees Celsius.
Observations of Eris have led scientists to believe that it has frozen methane on its surface.
Using a special instrument called a spectrometer, observations of Eris show it has frozen methane on its surface.
Photography is a form of time travel.
Haumea is a dwarf planet found in the Kuiper Belt. The Kuiper Belt is a big cloud of gas, dust, and rocky debris located at the outer edge of our solar system.
Haumea was first discovered in 2004.
Haumea is named after the Hawaiian goddess of childbirth. The two moons in orbit around Haumea were named after two of the children of Haumea. Hi'iaka is the larger moon, while the smaller moon was named Namaka.
It takes Earth years for Haumea to make one trip around the Sun.
Haumea is believed to be shaped like a plump cigar. The dwarf planet's rapid spin is thought to be the cause of this unusual shape.
Haumea has a rotation period of about hours. This is faster than any other known body larger than km in diameter. Scientists believe this rapid rotation was caused by a long ago collision that also created its moons.
Makemake was named after one of the gods from the Rapanui culture. The Rapanui people are natives of Easter Island. Easter Island is located in the southeastern Pacific Ocean.
You live in Rome? Me too!
Mary asked Tom to perform one of his magic tricks.
Makemake was first discovered in 2005. It was formally recognized as a dwarf planet in by the International Astronomical Union.
Makemake is located in the Kuiper Belt. The Kuiper Belt is an area of gas, dust, and rocky debris located at the outer edge of our solar system.
After Pluto and Eris, Makemake is the third largest dwarf planet.
It takes Earth years for Makemake to make one orbit around the Sun.
An asteroid is a bit of rock.
Asteroids can be a few feet to several hundred miles wide.
The asteroid belt contains at least 40,asteroids that are more than 0.miles across.
Astronomers think that if it were not for the giant planet Jupiter exerting its gravitational force on the asteroids in the belt, the inner planets would be constantly bombarded by large asteroids.
Scientists believe that comets are made up of material left over from when the Sun and the planets were formed.
Astronomers think that about 100,million comets orbit the Sun.
Most comets are thought to originate in a huge cloud called the Oort Cloud.
The Oort Cloud is believed to surround our solar system and reach over halfway to the nearest star, Alpha Centauri, which is 150,astronomical units away.
Scientists think that about million comets orbit the Sun.
A comet has a distinct center called a nucleus.
A hazy cloud called a coma surrounds the comet's nucleus.
The coma and the nucleus together form the comet's head.
The name comet comes from the Latin word cometa which means "long-haired".
The earliest known record of a comet sighting was made by an astrologer of the Chinese court in B.C.
If the comet nucleus is pulled into an orbit which carries it close to the Sun, the solar heat will cause the outer layers of the icy nucleus to evaporate.
As the comet gets closer to the Sun, the coma grows. The solar winds push the dust and gas away from the coma causing them to stream off into space to form the comet's tail.
The tails of comets can reach million kilometers in length!
Each time the comet passes close to the Sun, it loses some of its material. Over time, it will break up and disappear completely.
Halley's comet makes an appearance once every years.
Halley's comet was named after Sir Edmond Halley.
Records show that Halley's Comet has been observed for over years. Confirmed sightings of the comet go back to B.C.
The Bayeux Tapestry commemorates the Norman conquest of England in A.D.
Halley's comet is depicted inside the Bayeux Tapestry.
A meteoroid is a piece of stone-like or metal-like debris which travels in outer space.
Most meteoroids are no bigger than a pebble.
If a meteoroid falls into the Earth's atmosphere, it will begin to heat up and start to glow. This is called a meteor.
If you have ever seen a "falling star", you were actually seeing a meteor.
Any leftover part of the meteoroid that does strike the Earth is called a meteorite.
A meteorite can make a hole, or crater, in the ground when it hits it. The larger the meteorite, the bigger the hole.
Meteoroids burn up in the atmosphere and fall to the Earth as dust. Every day, approximately metric tons of dusty space material falls to Earth.
The fastest meteoroids move at about kilometers per second.
People often refer to meteors as "falling" or "shooting" stars.
When the Earth passes through an orbiting stream of debris from a comet that has broken up, what's known as a meteor shower occurs. Meteor showers take place on about the same dates each year.
Over meteorites hit the Earth each year. Fortunately, most of them are very small.
Ann Hodges of Sylacauga, Alabama was slightly injured when a 19.kilogram meteorite crashed through the roof of her home.
The Barringer Meteorite Crater near Winslow, Arizona is believed to have been formed about 49,years ago by the impact of a 300,ton meteorite.
The Hoba iron meteorite is the largest single meteorite known. Its present weight is estimated at tons.
The largest single meteorite found in the United States is the fifteen ton Willamette (Oregon) iron meteorite found in 1902.
On the night of November 16, 1966, the Leonid meteor shower, which occurs in November of each year, rained down on Arizona at the rate of meteors per minute for a minute period.
No one knows just how big the Universe is.
The universe is still growing outward in every direction.

The average American wedding costs about $30,000.
The school's dress code prohibits dyeing your hair a non-natural color.
Pink is not a natural hair color.
Our eyes can't see infrared light.
Scientists believe that about 13.billion years ago, a powerful explosion called the Big Bang happened. This powerful explosion set the universe into motion and this motion continues today.
The universe contains all of the galaxies, stars, and planets.
When an object moves away from Earth, the light that it is giving off is seen in longer wavelengths. When an object moves toward Earth, the light that it is giving off is seen in shorter wavelengths.
The doppler shift is a shift in an object's spectrum due to a change in the wavelength of light that occurs when an object is moving toward or away from Earth.
By looking at an object's electromagnetic spectrum, scientists can determine if an object is moving away from Earth or towards Earth.
A light-year is the distance light travels in one year. It's 9.trillion (9,500,000,000,000) kilometers.
Inside the prism, violet light slows down more than red light.
Violet light has a shorter wavelength than red light.
The size of a galaxy may be as little as a thousand light-years across or as much as a million light-years across.
A galaxy is a cluster of stars, dust, and gas which is held together by gravity.
Galaxies are scattered throughout the universe and they vary greatly in size.
Galaxies are classified by scientists according to their shape and appearance.
An irregular galaxy has an undefined shape and is full of young stars, dust, and gas.
A spiral galaxy is shaped like a disk. The disk tends to resemble a pinwheel with arms which spiral outward as it rotates.
Elliptical galaxies contain older stars and very little gas and dust. They vary in their shape from round to flattened, elongated spheres.
By studying the Doppler shift of different galaxies, scientists have concluded that all of the galaxies are moving away from each other.
The spiral galaxy closest to our Milky Way galaxy is Andromeda. Andromeda is over million light-years away. Its central bulge and spiral arms are tilted toward us at a degree angle.
The Andromeda galaxy is over million light-years away from us.
The spiral galaxy closest to our Milky Way galaxy is Andromeda.
Stars change over time. It may take millions to billions of years for a star to live out its life.
A star is a brilliantly glowing sphere of hot gas whose energy is produced by an internal nuclear fusion process.
A galaxy contains not only stars, but clouds of gas and dust.
Stars evolve, or change, over time. It may take millions of years or it may take billions of years for a star to complete its life cycle.
Stars are born inside clouds of gas and dust called nebulae.
In medium size stars, after the nuclear fusion has used up all the fuel it has, gravity will pull the remaining material closer together. The star will shrink. It is then called a "white dwarf".
In large size stars, nuclear fusion will continue until iron is formed. In stars, iron acts like an energy sponge. It soaks up the star's energy. This energy is eventually released in a big explosion called a supernova.
A star that is 1.to times larger than our Sun will become a neutron star. Stars that are even bigger than that will become black holes.
Neutron stars spin rapidly giving off radio waves. If the radio waves appear to be emitted in pulses (due to the star's spin), these neutron stars are called pulsars.
Most scientists believe that there is a black hole in the center of our very own Milky Way.
Black holes were once massive stars that used up all their fuel. As they died out, they collapsed inward due to the pull of their own gravity.
The gravity of a black hole is so powerful that not even light can escape its pull!
Once any matter falls into a black hole, it disappears from the visible universe.
Any object that gets too close to a black hole will be pulled inside it.
As objects fall toward the black hole, they heat up and get very hot.
Black holes are extremely compact space objects that were once massive stars which collapsed inward due to the force of their own gravity.
Black holes are very dense.
A black hole in the center of the Mgalaxy in the constellation Virgo, which is million light-years away, has been calculated to have a mass equal to that of billion Suns!
The gravitational pull of a black hole is so powerful that even light cannot escape from it.
There are over billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy.
There are over billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy. If you tried to count them one by one, it would take you over years!
The Milky Way is over 100,light-years wide.
The Milky Way is called a spiral galaxy because it has long arms which spin around like a giant pinwheel.
When you look up at the night sky, most of the stars you see are in one of the Milky Way arms.
Our solar system is 26,light-years from the center of the Galaxy.
All objects in the Galaxy revolve around the Galaxy's center.
It takes million years for our Sun to pull us through one revolution around the center of the Milky Way.
Quasars give off more energy than normal galaxies combined.
Cosmology is a branch of science which studies the evolution of our universe.
An hydrogen atom only has one proton and one electron.
Thales used the astronomical records of the Babylonians and Egyptians to accurately predict a solar eclipse in the sixth century BC.
Thales believed the Earth was flat and floated on water like a log.
Aristotle, who lived from to BC, believed the Earth was round. He thought Earth was the center of the universe and that the Sun, Moon, planets, and all the fixed stars revolved around it.
In the 100s BC, Hipparchus, the most important Greek astronomer of his time, calculated the comparative brightness of as many as 1,different stars. He also calculated the Moon's distance from the Earth.
Like most astronomers before him, Ptolemy believed the Sun, Moon, and other planets circled the Earth. He thought that each space body moved in a small circle (an epicycle) that was itself orbiting Earth.
Table salt is composed of sodium and chlorine atoms.
In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus suggested that the Sun was at the center of the universe.
Because the Church taught that the Earth was at the center of the universe, Copernicus' theory was regarded as heresy.
One night in 1572, Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe saw what he thought was a brilliant new star in the constellation Cassiopeia. (We now know he was observing a supernova.) In 1604, a second supernova was observed. These discoveries caused scientists to seriously question Ptolemy's theory that all stars were contained in an outermost sphere of the universe that never changed.
Galileo's discoveries forever changed the face of astronomy.
Newton was born in the same year that Galileo died.
Newton developed mathematical laws that explained how objects move on Earth as well as in space.
Newton explained the movement of orbiting planets as the result of motion along a straight line combined with the gravitational pull of the Sun. His laws are all based on the idea that nothing is naturally at rest. He reasoned that all heavenly bodies are constantly moving, with no limits on space and time.
In 1917, Albert Einstein proposed a description of the universe based on his Theory of General Relativity.
A major breakthrough in our understanding of the universe took place in the 1920's thanks to American astronomer Edwin Hubble.
For centuries, astronomers believed that the Milky Way made up the entire universe. Hubble was among the first to show that the fuzzy patches in the sky seen through telescopes were other galaxies, not distant parts of the Milky Way.
Georges Lemaitre, a Belgian astrophysicist and Catholic priest, came to be known as the "Father of the Big Bang".
Lemaitre proposed that the universe began as a single primordial atom of energy, something hot and dense that exploded, causing space to expand outward.
In the late 1940s, George Gamow, a Russian-American physicist, conceived of the Big Bang theory as we know it today. He and his colleagues proposed that if a big bang had occurred, it would have left an afterglow, traces of background radiation that would still be present.

The word astronaut means "star sailor" in Latin.
Many candidates withdraw their application after they realize the time and danger involved in being an astronaut.
An astronaut's salary is based on the civil service pay scale. Astronauts are ranked between a GS12, which earns $65,a year, and a GSthat earns $100,a year.
The astronauts had to use special tools to collect rock samples on the Moon because they could not bend over in their spacesuits.
Our universe is expanding.

In on December 21, Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders carried out the first Apollo mission which orbited the Moon.
On Apollo and Apollo missions, further testing of the lunar landing craft were carried out. This paved the way for the success of Apollo in landing on the lunar surface.
The mission of Apollo 13, though, was a near disaster as an explosion damaged the craft on the way to the Moon. The mission had to be aborted and re-entry was achieved only with great difficulty.
Apollo successfully completed its mission and returned to the Earth with 43.kilograms of lunar rocks and soil.
The lunar module of Apollo landed on the Moon on July 30, and the astronauts explored the surface riding in the first lunar rover.

Apollo brought back a large number of lunar rocks and soil samples.
The Soviet Union put a total of seven space stations in orbit between and 1982.
In 1973, the United States launched Skylab, a space station. It was designed so that astronauts could live and work in orbit for prolonged periods of time.
The space station not only served as a laboratory and living space for astronauts, but also as a support base for other spacecraft which had the ability to dock with the station.
In 1986, the Soviet Union launched the Space Station Mir. During its year lifetime, it was the largest space station to orbit the Earth.
In 1981, the United States launched the Space Shuttle Columbia, the first reusable manned spacecraft. It was piloted by Robert Crippen and commanded by John Young.

Dr. Valeri Polyakov, a Russian cosmonaut, was in space from January 8, to March 1995. He holds the record for the longest continuous stay in space.
During the years it was in orbit, Russia's Mir space station provided a home in space for more than one hundred cosmonauts and astronauts from at least twelve different countries.
Dan has a lengthy criminal background.
It takes about twelve minutes for the Space Shuttle to pass over the continental United States from California to New York. A Shuttle trip around the world takes only ninety minutes.
The Space Shuttle has the ability to take off like a rocket, orbit the Earth like a spaceship, and land on a runway like an airplane.
The space program suffered a devastating loss in January of when the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded seconds after launch in the skies over Cape Canaveral.
Dan has had the same job for more than six years.
Orchids were one of the first flowers to appear on Earth.

The Hubble Space Telescope was named after Edwin Hubble, an astronomer whose contributions to astronomy include a classification system for galaxies and the Hubble Constant.
The Hubble Constant defines the relationship between a galaxy's distance from the Earth and the speed with which the galaxy is moving away from the Earth.
The Hubble Space Telescope was originally due to be launched in 1986, but the explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger delayed the launch until April 24, 1990.
Once in orbit, a defect in the optical mirrors of the Hubble Space Telescope prevented the clarity that scientists had hoped for when viewing images provided by the telescope.
Data from Hubble are relayed to the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) that is in a geosynchronous orbit above Earth. This satellite relays the data to a terminal in White Sands, New Mexico.
Hubble has two solar panels which are each 2.meters by 11.meters in size. These panels convert sunlight directly into electricity.
Some of the technology created in the construction of the Hubble Space Telescope has been applied to create advances in medicine, computer chips, and the prevention of electrical power outages.
All of the astronauts on board Columbia were killed.
To be able to explore and work in space, humans have to take their environment with them because there is no atmosphere to supply the pressure and oxygen necessary to support life.
Without sufficient atmospheric pressure, body fluids will start to boil.
Without oxygen, we would be unable to breathe.
Today's spacesuits are pressurized, have an oxygen supply, protect the astronaut from micrometeoroid bombardment while spacewalking, and insulate the astronaut from the severe temperature changes experienced in space.
While working in the Shuttle during orbit, astronauts work in comfortable clothes such as knit shirts, pants, or flight suits.
Some space probes, such as Pioneer 10, fly out of our solar system and never come back. Other space probes, like the Hubble Space Telescope, stay in orbit around the same planet their whole life.

The Cassini spacecraft went into orbit around Saturn in July 2004. It will study the planet, its ring system, and many of its moons for at least years.
The New Horizons spacecraft was launched in 2006, and will arrive at Pluto in 2015. It will be the first spacecraft to visit that very distant dwarf planet.
The mission of the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory was to study gamma-ray emissions in not only our galaxy, but other galaxies beyond ours.
Most satellites, including the Hubble Space Telescope, orbit in a low Earth orbit of just a few hundred kilometers altitude.
Chandra has an elliptical orbit which takes it more than 138,kilometers from Earth and then back to within kilometers of Earth. Chandra travels more than one-third of the way to the Moon with each orbit!
Chandra records observations of the universe in the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Chandra's extraordinary capabilities make it possible for scientists to study such high-energy objects as supernovae and black holes in greater detail.
Chandra has the ability to record X-rays from clouds of gas with temperatures measuring in the millions of degrees.
The International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) was launched on July 26, 1978.
The International Ultraviolet Explorer provided information about physical conditions in the central regions of distant galaxies that may contain black holes. It also provided scientists with more knowledge of the physical conditions in very hot stars, the effect of solar winds on the atmospheres of the planets in our solar system, and the loss of mass from stars when stellar winds and flares occur.
The atom's nucleus is surrounded by an electron cloud.
The Infrared Astronomical Satellite's mission was to map the entire sky at infrared wavelengths. It was equipped with a special infrared telescope to scan the sky.
The Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE)'s mission was to study the microwave sky in order to detect radiation emitted by the Big Bang.
While surveying the sky in microwave wavelengths, COBE has transmitted evidence which supports the Big Bang Theory of the creation of the universe.
Pioneer was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and travel to the outer regions of the solar system.
Pioneer returned the first close-up pictures of Jupiter, measured the temperature of Jupiter's atmosphere, and mapped its magnetic field.
Pioneer flew past Saturn and its moon Titan in during which the first close-up images of that planet and its rings were radioed to Earth.
In 1986, four and one-half years after visiting Saturn, Voyager made the first close-up survey of Uranus.
The Voyager mission provided more information about Uranus and its moons than had been gathered since the planet's discovery.
Voyager completed its twelve year tour of the solar system with a visit to Neptune and its moons.
In 1989, Galileo was launched to examine Jupiter and its four largest moons.

Vikings and became the first space probes to successfully land on the surface of Mars.
Viking Lander was the first U.S. spacecraft to successfully touch down on any planet other than Earth.
Vikings and were launched in 1976, the year in which the United States celebrated its bicentennial.
The Viking probes analyzed gases in the Martian atmosphere and chemicals in the soil for evidence of the existence of simple life. The probes also measured wind speed, wind direction, atmospheric temperature, and atmospheric pressure.
In November of 1996, Mars Global Surveyor began a month mission to the Red Planet.
The Pathfinder Lander carried onboard a robotic rover named Sojourner. The kilogram solar-powered rover was equipped with a spectrometer used to analyze the chemical composition of Martian rock and a camera which relayed images of the landscape back to Earth.
As part of their mission to explore Mars, NASA launched twin robotic rovers on June and July 7, 2003. For landing, each rover was encased in a beachball-like apparatus with a parachute attached.
Both rovers landed during the Martian afternoon while Earth was still in view. This allowed the rovers to communicate with Earth via the Deep Space Network, letting scientists know they had landed safely.
The rovers, named Spirit and Opportunity, landed on the Martian surface approximately three weeks apart in January, 2004.
The rovers were designed to last a minimum of days on the Martian surface.
Mariner was the first space probe to visit Mercury. It was also the first probe to visit two planets - Venus and Mercury.
Mariner used the gravitational pull of Venus to swing it into a different orbit so it could continue on to Mercury.
Until Mariner 10, astronomers were not sure what Mercury really looked like because it is so close to the Sun.
On August 3, 2004, NASA launched the MESSENGER mission to Mercury. It will fly by Earth, Venus, and Mercury itself several times before settling into orbit around our innermost planet in March 2011.
Over 16,different technical and scientific experiments were carried out aboard Mir.
Most of the station disintegrated as it fell through Earth's atmosphere.

John Couch Adams was born in England in 1819. He was born to a farming family.
When Adams was very young he showed a talent for doing math. He could do very difficult math problems in his head.
From a very early age he amazed everyone with his extraordinary abilities to do mathematical calculations in his head without the use of pen and paper.
While still an undergraduate, Adams performed an investigation to try to explain the reason for the irregularities in the motion of the planet Uranus. He theorized that the unexpected planetary orbit could be due to the presence of an as yet undiscovered planet.
John Couch Adams showed great mathematical ability before he ever went to college.
Jocelyn Bell was born in in Northern Ireland. Her father was an architect who loved to read. Jocelyn would often borrow her father's books. Through her reading, Jocelyn became interested in astronomy.
Jocelyn Bell went to a boarding school in England from until 1961.
When they were not sure what caused the signals they detected, Jocelyn Bell and her college advisor D. Anthony Hewish labeled the signal LGM for Little Green Men. They thought it could possibly be a beacon from an alien source.
Her father was an architect and an avid reader.
Jocelyn Bell's parents very strongly believed in educating women.
It was while she was a graduate student at Cambridge, working under the direction of Antony Hewish, that Jocelyn Bell discovered pulsars.
In 1974, the Nobel Prize in physics was jointly awarded to astronomers Antony Hewish and Sir Martin Ryle. Antony Hewish was honored for the discovery of pulsars. Many have argued that Jocelyn Bell Burnell should have shared that honor.
All of the instruments Tycho Brahe used to observe the sky were made in his own workshop. He also printed all of his books on his own presses.
Tycho Brahe was born in in Denmark.
He was born to a noble family.
Brahe had a brother who grew up to serve in the government. He also had a sister that became a scientist.
Tycho Brahe was a favorite of the king of Denmark, King Fredrik II. King Fredrik gave him an island to live on.
While living on his island, Brahe built a castle and an observatory.
Brahe made many observations of the stars.
Tycho Brahe was the nephew of Jorges Brahe, a sailor who gave his life in an effort to save the life of King Fredrik II of Denmark.
Tycho Brahe benefited greatly from King Fredrik's generous support.
Brahe received an island called Hven from the king.
He turned this island into his own little country.
Brahe built a castle on the island and named it Uraniborg after Urania, the goddess of the sky. He also built an observatory on the island.
For over years, Brahe used the island as his base from which to make astronomical observations.
In 1597, Tycho Brahe lost the Danish king's support, so he went to Wandsbek in what is today known as Germany.
Over a year period of time, Tycho Brahe made consistent observations which supported the heliocentric theory proposed earlier by Copernicus. These observations were made using only a compass and a sextant.
Brahe catalogued over stars.
Tycho Brahe proved that comets were not just components of Earth's atmosphere, but actual objects traveling through space.
Brahe invented many instruments such as the Tyconian Quadrant which were widely copied and led to the invention of improved observational equipment.
In 1600, Tycho Brahe hired Johannes Kepler as his assistant. In later years, Kepler would use Brahe's work as the basis for the laws of planetary movement which he developed.
Tycho Brahe, though of noble decent, married a commoner. Together they had three sons and five daughters.
Brahe died in 1601. His last words, "Ne frusta vixisse vidar" (May I not seemed to have lived in vain") were recorded by his assistant Kepler.
Within a few years of his death, the castle and observatory he built on his beloved island Hven were destroyed.
Tycho Brahe used only a compass and a sextant to observe the stars.
Neil Armstrong flew aboard Gemini 8. While in orbit, he and fellow astronaut David Scott carried out the first docking in space between two vehicles.
Neil Alden Armstrong was born on August 5, in Wapakoneta, Ohio.
Neil has a bachelors degree in aerospace engineering from Purdue University. He also has a masters degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Southern California.
Neil Armstrong was a test pilot when he was chosen to be an astronaut.
As a test pilot, Neil Armstrong made flights in the X-aircraft. He was able to attain an altitude of 63,meters (207,feet).
In July of 1969, Neil Armstrong was the commander of Apollo 11, America's first attempt to land a manned vehicle on the Moon.
On July 20, Commander Armstrong and fellow astronaut Edwin Aldrin successfully touched down on the lunar surface.
He and Aldrin explored the Moon's surface for 2.hours.
Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of his accomplishments and his contributions to the space program.
Neil Armstrong was married and had two children.
Neil Armstrong is one of only people that have walked on the Moon's surface.
Copernicus worked at many different jobs. He was a doctor, lawyer, author, judge and tax collector.
Nicolaus Copernicus was born in Poland in 1473.
His father died when he was a boy.
Nicolaus was raised by his uncle.
People who spoke out against Church teachings could be put to death.
The Church taught that the Sun and all the planets revolved around Earth.
Nicolaus Copernicus became interested in astronomy while he was a university student in Italy.
Copernicus wrote all of his ideas in a book called On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres.
He was the son of a wealthy merchant.
Nicolaus Copernicus is considered the founder of modern astronomy.
As a boy, Franklin dreamed of moving to the United States to become an astronaut.
Copernicus studied mathematics and astronomy at the University of Krakow.
Copernicus studied law and medicine at the universities of Bologna, Padua, and Ferrara in Italy.
In Copernicus' time most astronomers believed the theory the Greek astronomer Ptolomy had developed more than 1,years earlier. Ptolomy said the Earth was the center of the universe and was motionless. He believed all other heavenly bodies moved in complicated patterns around the Earth.
Copernicus felt that Ptolemy's theory was incorrect. Sometime between and 1515, he first circulated the principles of his heliocentric or Sun-centered astronomy.
From his observations, Copernicus concluded that every planet, including Earth, revolved around the Sun.
For relaxation, Copernicus painted and translated Greek poetry into Latin.
Colonel Collins was the first woman to be in charge of a Space Shuttle mission.

John set a transcontinental speed record by flying from Los Angeles to New York in hours and minutes.
John Glenn was selected as one of seven Project Mercury astronauts in 1959. In February of 1962, he became the first American to orbit Earth.
Yuri Gagarin was born near Moscow, Russia on March 9, 1934.
Yuri joined the Soviet Air Force in 1955.
On April 12, Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit Earth.
Yuri Gagarin was killed in a plane crash before he could travel in space a second time.
When Yuri Gagarin took off in Vostok 1, he was an Air Force lieutenant. When he landed, he was a major.
Colonel Yuri A. Gagarin was born on a collective farm in a region west of Moscow, Russia on March 9, 1934.
His father was a carpenter.
Yuri graduated with honors from the Soviet Air Force Academy in 1957.
Yuri Gagarin flew only one space mission.
Once in orbit, Yuri Gagarin had no control over his spacecraft. Vostok's reentry was controlled by a computer program sending radio commands to the space capsule.
Although the controls were locked, a key had been placed in a sealed envelope in case an emergency situation made it necessary for Gagarin to take control of the spacecraft.
After his successful space flight, the Soviet Union paid its official thanks to Yuri Gagarin. There was a six-hour parade through Red Square, followed by a ceremony at the Lenin Mausoleum where Gagarin was greeted by General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev.
Galileo was the first person to look at the Moon through a telescope.
Galileo Galilei was born in Pisa, Italy in 1564.
His father wanted him to be a doctor.
Galileo wanted to work with mathematics.
Galileo first discovered that the Moon had mountains just like Earth.
Copernicus believed the Earth and other planets moved around the Sun.
During Galileo's time, the Catholic Church was very powerful and it taught that the Earth was the center of the universe. Galileo was told not to write or say that the Earth orbited the Sun.
In 1632, Galileo published a book that said the Earth orbited the Sun. The Catholic Church arrested him and put him on trial.
Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galilei, was a well-known musician.
In 1609, Galileo heard about the invention of the spyglass, a device which made distant objects appear closer. Galileo used his mathematical knowledge and technical skills to improve upon the spyglass and build a telescope.
Heresy was a crime for which people were sometimes sentenced to death.
Galileo was cleared of charges of heresy, but was told that he should no longer publicly state his belief that Earth moved around the Sun.
In 1632, he published a book that stated, among other things, that the heliocentric theory of Copernicus was correct. Galileo was once again called before the Inquisition and this time was found guilty of heresy.
Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1633. Because of his age and poor health, he was allowed to serve his imprisonment under house arrest.
Galileo died on January 8, 1642.
Galileo designed a variety of scientific instruments. Among them was the hydrostatic balance. This was an instrument used to find the specific gravity of objects by weighing them in water.
Albert Einstein was born in in Ulm, Germany.
There is a crater on the Moon named after Albert Einstein.
Einstein decided to study math and physics so he could become a teacher.
In 1896, Einstein renounced his German citizenship. He was not a citizen of any country until when he became a citizen of Switzerland.
In 1901, Einstein took a job as a temporary high school teacher and married Mileva Maritsch.
Einstein later married his cousin Elsa Einstein.
From through 1909, Einstein worked in a patent office in Bern, Switzerland. While working in the patent office he published many papers on theoretical physics.
In Einstein wrote a paper on what is now known as the special theory of relativity.
In Einstein published his general theory of relativity. This theory linked gravitation, acceleration and the four dimensional space-time.
Einstein won the Nobel Prize for Physics in for his work on the photoelectric effect.
Einstein was not only a scientist, but also a social activist and a humanitarian.
Einstein traveled the world lecturing and raising funds for a planned Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
In December of 1932, Einstein left for the United States. A month after his departure the Nazis assumed control of Germany. He never returned to Germany.
In Einstein was granted permanent residency in the United States and became a citizen in 1940.
By Einstein was in failing health. His health was so bad that when offered the presidency of Israel in he had to decline it.
Albert Einstein is considered one of the most brilliant minds of the twentieth century.
Einstein also showed how mass and energy were equivalent.
Sergei Pavlovich Korolev was born in in the Ukraine, then a part of Russia.
Korolev eventually fell out of favor with the Stalin regime and was thrown in prison.
The Russian prison system, known as the Gulag, was a very brutal place.
After the demise of Stalin, Korolev gained the support of the new leader, Nikita Khrushchev.
Korolev was responsible for the Sputnik program, which in launched the first artificial satellite into orbit.
Sergei Korolev died in 1966.

Caroline Herschel was a singer, mathematician and astronomer.
Caroline Herschel was born in Germany in 1750. She was one of six children.
Tom was not very good in school.
Her father was a talented musician.
Isaac Herschel encouraged all six of his children to train in mathematics, French and music.
Caroline's mother did not see the need for a girl to become educated.
At the age of ten Caroline was stricken with typhus. The disease permanently stunted her growth.
Her parents concluded that she would never marry but would live her life as an old maid.
Caroline became her brother's housekeeper.
William was an accomplished musician and a conductor. He gave Caroline voice lessons and trained her in mathematics as well.
Caroline became a well known soprano and began to sing professionally.
William's hobby was astronomy and he devoted most of his free time to making more and more powerful telescopes with which to look deeper into space.
William's reputation as a telescope maker grew to such an extent that he quit his job as a musician and devoted all of his time to the making of telescopes and to astronomy.
Caroline began to help her brother in the manufacture of telescopes and to share his passion for astronomy.

Clyde Tombaugh was only twenty-four years old when he discovered Pluto.
Clyde Tombaugh was born on a farm in Illinois. His father was a farmer.
Clyde's dad loved to study the stars.
He even learned to make his own telescopes to study the sky.
Okay, Tom, that's enough!
Clyde dreamed of going to college and becoming an astronomer.
There was a big storm the year Clyde planned to go to college. The family's crops were ruined by the storm. There was no money to pay for college.
Can't this wait until tomorrow?
Clyde used a telescope he built himself to study Mars and Jupiter. He then drew pictures of what he saw.
The astronomers were so pleased with Clyde's drawings that they offered him a job.
Clyde was dissatisfied with his store-bought telescope and decided to build one for himself. Clyde's father took a second job to pay for the materials needed to build it.
The telescope Clyde built in was only the first of more than thirty telescopes he was to build over his lifetime.
Clyde made very detailed drawings of his telescopic observations of Jupiter and Mars.
Clyde joined the search for Percival Lowell's "Planet X", a planet beyond Neptune.
Clyde Tombaugh's job was to photograph one small piece of the night sky at a time. He then had to carefully examine and compare the photos in an effort to detect an unidentified moving point of light that might be a planet.
Clyde Tombaugh photographed 65% of the sky and spent thousands of hours examining photographs of the night sky.
After ten months of very hard work, sometimes working through the night in an unheated dome, Clyde Tombaugh discovered an object he named Pluto.
For many years, Pluto was considered to be the ninth planet in our solar system.
Clyde Tombaugh died at the age of ninety on January 17, 1997.
Clyde Tombaugh also discovered several star clusters, a comet and more than a hundred asteroids.
Valentina Tereshkova was honored with the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.
Her father was a tractor driver.
Valentina's mother worked in a textile plant.
Valentina started school in when she was eight years old. She left school to begin working in a textile plant in 1953.
She was able to continue her education through correspondence courses.
Valentina became interested in parachute jumping when she was young.
On June 16,Valentina Tereshkova was launched into space aboard Vostok 6. She became the first woman to travel in space.
Valentina Tereshkova made orbits of Earth. She spent almost three days in space.
In November of 1963, Valentina Tereshkova married Andriyan Nikolayev. He was also a cosmonaut. Their daughter, Elena, was born in 1964.
Elena was the first child born to a mother and a father who had both traveled in space.
Valentina Tereshkova never made a second trip into space. She became an important member of the Communist Party and a representative of the Soviet government.

Her father was a tractor driver and her mother worked in a textile plant.
She received the United Nations Gold Medal of Peace.
The second woman to fly in space was Svetlana Savytskaya in onboard Soyuz T-7.
Alan Shepard was the first American to enter space.
Shepard served on a destroyer during World War II.
Though Shepard spent only minutes in actual space aboard Freedom 7, he laid the groundwork for the United States to become the great innovator in space exploration we know today.
While on the Moon Shepard played golf with a club he had carried onboard the lunar spacecraft of Apollo 14.
Shepard became an admiral in the United States Navy, the first astronaut to ever achieve such a rank.
Dr. Carl Sagan helped design the plaques carried by both Pioneer and Pioneer 11. These plaques, bearing the images of a man and a woman as well as a diagram showing Earth's location in the Galaxy, may one day be found by an extraterrestrial civilization.
Writing French is more difficult than speaking it.
Dr. Sagan helped to popularize science through the writing of hundreds of articles and over two dozen books.
Carl Sagan's television series "Cosmos" became the most watched show in public television history.
"Cosmos" was seen by more than million people in different countries.
Sagan's scientific curiosity led him to earn four degrees in physics, astronomy and astrophysics from the University of Chicago.
Dr. Sagan suffered from a rare bone marrow disease called myelodysplasia.
The science fiction movie "Contact" was based on a book co-authored by Carl Sagan and his wife Ann Druyan.
As a young girl, she wanted to become a professional tennis player and, at one time, was a ranked player on the junior tennis circuit.
As a young girl, Mary wanted to become a professional tennis player.
If you speak French, it'll be better for me.
The little child was fretting for its mother when it was left at the child care centre for the first time.
If you have a lot of time, you don't have to spend money to learn a language.
Tom's boss is much-maligned, but Tom's always found him reasonable.
Sally Ride attended Stanford University where she earned four degrees.
Dr. Ride has a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics. She also has a Masters degree in Physics and a Ph.D. in Physics.
Dr. Ride was committed to promoting science and math education to all learners.

Something about the situation made Tom feel very uneasy.
In addition to mathematics, physics and astronomy, Newton also had an interest in alchemy, mysticism and theology.
Isaac Newton was born in in Woolsthorpe, England.
His father was a wealthy, uneducated farmer who died three months before Newton was born.
Newton's mother remarried and he was left in the care of his grandmother.
Though Newton did not excel in school, he did earn the opportunity to attend Trinity College Cambridge where he wanted to study law.
His mother refused to pay for his education so while at college he worked as a servant to pay his way.
Newton became interested in mathematics after buying a book at a fair and not understanding the math concepts it contained.
The further pursuit of an education was interrupted by the plague.
As the years progressed, Newton completed his work on universal gravitation, diffraction of light, centrifugal force, centripetal force, inverse-square law, bodies in motion and the variations in tides due to gravity.
His impressive body of work made him a leader in scientific research.
In 1679, Newton's work came to standstill after he suffered a nervous breakdown.
His earlobes were large and fleshy.
Where is the coffee machine?
Newton became Warden of the Royal Mint in 1696. He became Master of the Royal Mint in 1699.
Newton was instrumental in developing techniques to prevent counterfeiting of the English money.
Queen Anne knighted Newton in 1705. He was the first scientist to be knighted for his work.
Sometimes, as the Earth orbits the Sun, it comes between the Sun and the Moon. When this happens, the Earth throws a dark shadow across the Moon. This is known as an eclipse of the Moon, or a lunar eclipse.
Sometimes, the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun. The Moon blocks the light of the Sun and a shadow of the Moon is cast on the Earth's surface. This is an eclipse of the Sun, or a solar eclipse.
There are three types of a solar eclipse: total, partial, and annular.
During a total eclipse, the Moon completely covers our view of the Sun.
A total eclipse is only visible from a narrow strip (about km wide) of the Earth's surface at any one time.
Give me some water.
We bought some bread.
I have some friends.
The eclipse type that occurs when the Moon is at its farthest distance from the Earth is an annular eclipse. The Moon then appears too small to completely block out the disk of the Sun.
There are usually between two and five lunar eclipses each year.
My father used to read me stories when I was a little girl.
My parents used to read me stories when I was a little boy.
The average distance between stars within our galaxy is about light years.
She took me under her wing and taught me everything she knew.
Perhaps we should do something about it.
A light morning breeze was blowing across the road.
I'm just making sure.
She put some butter on her bread.
Did you put on some sunscreen?
They're putting me in a difficult position.
He has an unquenchable desire for justice.

When written as a numerical date, March 14, is 3/14/15, corresponding to the first five digits of pi (3.1415) - a once-in-a-century coincidence!
Pi day is a great day to eat pie.
John rents the house and I sublet a room from him.
Her remarks were so rude they were frankly unprintable.
A total solar eclipse, or a complete blocking out of the Sun's light, can only be seen by those who live in the area covered by the umbra. People who live in the area of the Earth covered by the penumbra will see a partial eclipse.
Cats and mice are natural enemies.
When the Moon and Sun are in a perfect line, it is called a total eclipse. These are very rare. Most people only see one in their lifetime.
Once the Sun is totally eclipsed, the Sun's corona can be seen shining in all directions around the Moon. This is a spectacular sight because the only time the Sun's corona can be seen is during a total solar eclipse.
Also visible during a total solar eclipse are colorful lights from the Sun's chromosphere and solar prominences shooting out through the Sun's atmosphere.
Urbain Jean Joseph Le Verrier was born in at Saint-Lô, France.
By 1845, Le Verrier had become interested in the motion of the planet Uranus. Uranus did not have the orbit scientists expected it to have based on their mathematical calculations.
Through mathematical calculations, Le Verrier predicted the presence of another planet beyond Uranus. The gravitational pull of this planet would explain the unusual motion of Uranus.
Le Verrier expected to be declared the sole discoverer of Neptune, but months prior to his calculations being completed John Couch Adams, an English mathematician, had accomplished the same feat. As a consequence, Le Verrier and Adams share the honor as Neptune's discoverers.
In 1854, Le Verrier became director of the Observatory of Paris. At the time, this observatory was in decay. Le Verrier reestablished the observatory as a place where good science was taking place.
The Moon orbits Earth at an average distance of 382,kilometers.
What's your favorite nail polish color?
The lunar month is the 29.days it takes to go from one new moon to the next.
During the lunar month, the Moon goes through all its phases.
Just like the Earth, half of the Moon is lit by the Sun while the other half is in darkness.
The phases of the Moon result from the angle the Moon makes with the Sun as viewed from Earth.
We only see the Moon because sunlight reflects back to us from its surface.
The half of the Moon facing the Sun is always lit.
The half of the Moon facing the Sun is always lit, but the lit side does not always face the Earth.
At new moon, the Moon is lined up between the Earth and the Sun. We see the side of the Moon that is not being lit by the Sun. In other words, we see no Moon at all, because the brightness of the Sun outshines the dim Moon!
As the Moon moves eastward away from the Sun in the sky, we see a bit more of the sunlit side of the Moon each night.
A few days after new moon, we see a thin crescent in the western evening sky. The crescent Moon waxes, or appears to grow fatter, each night.
Children must obey their parents and parents must obey their employers.
When half of the Moon's disc is illuminated, we call it the first quarter moon. This name comes from the fact that the Moon is now one-quarter of the way through the lunar month.
Once more than half of the disc of the Moon is illuminated, it has a shape we call gibbous.
The gibbous moon appears to grow fatter each night until we see the full sunlit face of the Moon. We call this phase the full moon.
During the second half of the lunar month, the Moon grows thinner each night. We call this waning.
Every second, the Sun converts million tons of its material into heat and light through the process of nuclear fusion.
Scientists of the 19th century believed that the Sun was powered by chemical reactions.
Einstein showed that mass can be converted into energy and vice-versa.
In 1920, British astronomer Arthur Eddington proposed that the Sun and other stars are powered by nuclear reactions.
Hans Bethe won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work concerning energy production in stars.
Each kind of atom has a certain unique number of particles called protons, neutrons, and electrons in it.
The protons and neutrons cluster together in the center of the atom in what is called the nucleus. The electrons orbit around the nucleus.
Atoms are very, very small.
The simplest atom is hydrogen.
The nucleus of a hydrogen atom consists of a single proton. Around this proton orbits a single electron.
There is more hydrogen in the universe than any other kind of atom.
Helium is the second simplest atom. It consists of a nucleus containing protons and two neutrons. Around the nucleus orbits electrons.
A positron is a small particle similar to an electron, but with a positive electric charge.
Protons have a positive charge, electrons have a negative charge, and neutrons have no charge.
One of the best meteor showers, the Perseids, happens in August.
The Earth has been hit before by asteroids and will be again someday.
I think that I'm doing something wrong.
The asteroids capable of causing a global disaster if they hit the Earth are extremely rare.
In March 1999, Marcy and Butler announced the detection of the first true other "solar system" in which they found evidence of planets orbiting a single star. The star is called Upsilon Andromedae.
There are official constellations.
Most constellations don't really resemble the creatures or characters they are named after.
Constellations can be a useful way to help identify positions of stars in the sky.
The individual stars in a constellation may appear to be very close to each other, but in fact they can be separated by huge distances in space and have no real connection to each other at all.
At different times of year, different constellations can be seen in the sky.
Tom is just a lazy good-for-nothing.
I spent the whole day in bed doing absolutely nothing.
When you see the Sun shining in the sky, it is day, and when you don't it is night.
Does spending money make you happy?
Spending money doesn't make me happy, but buying things does.
It is actually possible to say exactly the same thing in Swedish.
She was very impatient with her children.
The ancient Greeks believed that the Sun rode across the sky in a chariot drawn by four white horses driven by the god Heleius.
The Sun appears to move across the sky because the Earth rotates on its axis.
At the equator, the Earth is rotating at a speed of about about kilometers per hour.
Some scientists think that gravity is made up of particles called gravitons which travel at the speed of light.
Gravity is a force of attraction that exists between any two masses, any two bodies, or any two particles.
Newton discovered that a force is required to change the speed or direction of movement of an object.
Newton's law of gravity is a mathematical description of the way bodies are observed to attract one another, based on many scientific experiments and observations.
The force of gravity between two objects is proportional to the product of the two masses, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers of mass.
The effect of gravity extends from each object out into space in all directions, and for an infinite distance.
The strength of the gravitational force reduces quickly with distance.
It's the Sun's gravity that keeps the Earth in its orbit.
The Moon's gravity is responsible for the ocean tides on Earth.
It's probably just a myth that Isaac Newton discovered the laws of gravity when an apple fell on his head while he was sitting under a tree.
Many astronomers are working hard to measure the Hubble constant using a variety of different techniques.
It's impossible for someone to be older than his mother.

Tom dreads going to work every morning.
Mankind's journey into space began in when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite.
She is careless about her attire.
A light-year is a unit of distance. It is the distance that light can travel in one year.
The Astronomical Unit (AU) is defined as the average distance between the Earth and the Sun. It is approximately million km (million miles).
The parsec is equal to about 3.light-years.
The Sun—in fact, our whole solar system—orbits around the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.
It takes the Sun about million years to make one complete orbit around the Milky Way.
The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy.
This is an elementary error of reasoning.
Sunspots are regions of the Sun where the solar magnetic field is very strong.
Sunspots appear darker than their surroundings because they are a few thousand degrees cooler.
Most of the surface of the Sun has a temperature of about degrees C, but in a big sunspot the temperature can drop to about degrees C.
You must practice writing Swedish.
You should never look directly at the Sun with the naked eye.
You should never look directly at the Sun with the naked eye or through any instrument such as binoculars or a telescope.
The Andromeda Galaxy, also called M31, is bright enough to be seen by the naked eye on dark, moonless nights.
Seasons are reversed in the southern hemisphere.
Why is space black?
If the universe is full of stars, why doesn't the light from all of them add up to make the whole sky bright all the time?

Sometimes, a small change can have a big effect.
Sometimes, a small change can make a big difference.
This knowledge can be used both for good or evil.
The official names of planets and their moons are governed by the International Astronomical Union.
The human eye is blind to nearly the entire electromagnetic spectrum, except for the very narrow range of light that falls in what we call the visible range.
Within the past years, astronomers have developed the ability to view the universe in radio waves, gamma-rays, and all energies in between. This ability has allowed us to discover amazing events in our universe.
There are several current theories about the possible causes of gamma-ray bursts.
It's natural to get nervous when a plane takes off.
Tom left his job because he hated his boss.
If you want to travel to a store located km from your house, and you drive at km/h, it would take you minutes to get there.
If you want to travel to a store located km from your house, and you drive at km/h, how long would it take you to get there?
At a speed of km/sec, it would take about 75,years to reach Proxima Centauri, the second nearest star from Earth.
Space is big, really, really, really big.
Today’s spacecraft use rockets and rockets use large quantities of propellant.
As propellant blasts out of the rocket in one direction, it pushes the spacecraft in the other.
According to Newton's Third Law of Motion "Every action has an equal and opposite reaction."
Thrust is how much push a rocket can give.
Specific Impulse can be thought of as a kind of fuel efficiency for rocket engines, analogous to the miles-per-gallon for cars.
