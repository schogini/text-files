Just act like nothing happened.

There are many ways to do this.

Latin is a perfect language.
Once upon a time there was a piece of wood.
Give him what he wants.
Give her what she wants.
His real name was Mastro Antonio, but everyone called him Mastro Cherry, for the tip of his nose was so round and red and shiny that it looked like a ripe cherry.
Tom refused to give Mary what she wanted.
The experiment was a failure.
The experiment was a success.
As soon as he saw that piece of wood, Mastro Cherry was filled with joy.
He grasped the hatchet to peel off the bark and shape the wood.
He heard a wee, little voice say in a beseeching tone: "Please be careful! Do not hit me so hard!"
Where did that voice come from, when there is no one around? Might it be that this piece of wood has learned to weep and cry like a child?
His name was Geppetto, but to the boys of the neighborhood he was Polendina, on account of the wig he always wore which was just the color of yellow corn.
He works in a cannery.
It could save your life.
He's a professional diver.
He's an underwater archaeologist.
Geppetto had a very bad temper. Woe to the one who called him Polendina! He became as wild as a beast and no one could soothe him.
I thought of making myself a beautiful wooden marionette.
When the fight was over, Mastro Antonio had Geppetto's yellow wig in his hands and Geppetto found the carpenter's curly wig in his mouth.
Give me back my wig!
It's said that the Vikings discovered America before Columbus did.
They say that the Vikings discovered America before Columbus.
The two little old men, each with his own wig back on his own head, shook hands and swore to be good friends for the rest of their lives.
I want a piece of wood to make a marionette. Will you give it to me?
Little as Geppetto's house was, it was neat and comfortable.
As soon as he reached home, Geppetto took his tools and began to cut and shape the wood into a marionette.
"What shall I call him?" he said to himself. "I think I'll call him Pinocchio."
She refused all proposals of marriage.
Turn around and face the wall.
Every vote counts.
After the eyes, Geppetto made the nose, which began to stretch as soon as finished. It stretched and stretched and stretched till it became so long, it seemed endless.
He's a valiant soldier.
Tom fractured his wrist.
How did you sprain your wrist, Tom?

I want to be a linguist.
It's still unclear to many, especially to those who half destroyed it and surrendered it to Iran, whether Iraq should be pronounced e-rack or aye-rack. But, after all, is it necessary to know how to pronounce a country's name before whacking it ?
The tables have turned and the surrender-monkeys are now those who then called others that way.
Get on it.
Please, be patient with me!
That sounds awesome!

If Tom had made that investment, he'd be a billionaire today.
He can't afford to retire.
Some bolts need to be tightened up.
He walked out the door and never came back.
Small children work as slaves on the chocolate plantation.
Are you serious about that question?
The resemblance between these two men is uncanny.
Is there anything else I need to know?
Tom is tall and thin.
This tall and thin young man had a spontaneous pneumothorax.
This doesn't seem normal.
Tom suffered from a collapsed lung.
The knife punctured his lung.
My worst fears came true.
It wasn't always this way.
Pinocchio's legs were so stiff that he could not move them.
Catch him! Catch him!
Catch her! Catch her!
The Carabineer grabbed him by the nose (it was an extremely long one and seemed made on purpose for that very thing) and returned him to Mastro Geppetto.
The little old man wanted to pull Pinocchio's ears. Think how he felt when, upon searching for them, he discovered that he had forgotten to make them!
His happiness lasted only a short time.
Pinocchio turned and saw a large cricket crawling slowly up the wall.
I am the Talking Cricket and I have been living in this room for more than one hundred years.
Woe to boys who refuse to obey their parents and run away from home! They will never be happy in this world, and when they are older they will be very sorry for it.
If I stay here the same thing will happen to me which happens to all other boys and girls. They are sent to school, and whether they want to or not, they must study. As for me, let me tell you, I hate to study! It's much more fun, I think, to chase after butterflies, climb trees, and steal birds' nests.
If you do not like going to school, why don't you at least learn a trade, so that you can earn an honest living?
"Of all the trades in the world, there is only one that really suits me." "And what can that be?" "That of eating, drinking, sleeping, playing, and wandering around from morning till night."
Careful, ugly Cricket! If you make me angry, you'll be sorry!
"Poor Pinocchio, I am sorry for you." "Why?" "Because you are a marionette and, what is much worse, you have a wooden head."
At these last words, Pinocchio jumped up in a fury, took a hammer from the bench, and threw it with all his strength at the Talking Cricket.
With a last weak "cri-cri-cri" the poor Cricket fell from the wall, dead!
I have never seen anything quite like this.
France, Austria and Russia formed an alliance against Prussia.
What's the difference between a star and a planet?
He was surprised by what he found.
Mary was a good-hearted girl who helped wherever she could.
His books have been translated into several languages.
Stars undergo nuclear reactions that burn hydrogen in their cores.
But Tom had one final trick up his sleeve.
That would be so funny.
What is Freedom Flotilla?
Do you wear shoes indoors?
Do you wear shoes inside your house?
Why would anyone think that was a good idea?
That's just an old wives' tale.
I'm glad it works for you.
Tom works on a sheep farm.
I'm in the post office.
"Where's the water?" "It evaporated."
Tom devoted his life to finding a solution to the problem.
That sounds like a fun job.
Peter the Cruel is also known as Peter the Just.
He's tall and muscular.
He's a star in Germany, but completely unknown in America.
He married her in secret.
A brown dwarf is a celestial object, in which fusion occurs, but that is not massive enough to fuse hydrogen.
She bore him four children.
She has a fake tan.
She's just so fake.
That is why she didn't want to be with him any more.
Do you find it easy to deal with the people you meet in the course of your work?
How cold is Canada?
Canada is a very cold country.
Everybody hates them.
Everybody hates him.
Everybody hates her.
This is a step in the right direction.
Tom is a zookeeper.
Tom is a seaman.
Tom stole his dad's credit card.
Tom is a frequent flyer.
A boy's appetite grows very fast.
He was as ravenous as a bear.
His long nose became at least two inches longer.
The Talking Cricket was right. It was wrong of me to disobey Father and to run away from home. If he were here now, I wouldn't be so hungry! Oh, how horrible it is to be hungry!
The night was pitch black.
It thundered, and bright flashes of lightning now and again shot across the sky, turning it into a sea of fire.
An angry wind blew cold and raised dense clouds of dust, while the trees shook and moaned in a weird way.
Pinocchio was greatly afraid of thunder and lightning, but the hunger he felt was far greater than his fear.
The whole village was dark and deserted. The stores were closed, the doors, the windows. In the streets, not even a dog could be seen. It seemed the Village of the Dead.
An old man in a nightcap opened the window and looked out. He called down angrily: "What do you want at this hour of night?"
There he fell asleep, and while he slept, his wooden feet began to burn. Slowly, very slowly, they blackened and turned to ashes.
Is Tom a member of the Royal Family?
"Open! I say," repeated Geppetto, "or I'll give you a sound whipping when I get in."
My little Pinocchio, my dear little Pinocchio! How did you burn your feet?
Mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe.
I never liked school.
I should never have thought, dear boy of mine, that you were so dainty and fussy about your food. Bad, very bad! In this world, even as children, we must accustom ourselves to eat of everything, for we never know what life may hold in store for us!
I will not eat the pears if they are not peeled. I don't like them.
"I promise you," answered the marionette, sobbing, "that from now on I'll be good‚Äî"
Boys always promise that when they want something.
I promise to go to school every day, to study, and to succeed.
But I am not like other boys! I am better than all of them and I always tell the truth. I promise you, Father, that I'll learn a trade, and I'll be the comfort and staff of your old age.
It's the deadliest city in America.
Close your eyes and sleep!
Pinocchio closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep.
Geppetto did not have a penny in his pocket, so he made his son a little suit of flowered paper, a pair of shoes from the bark of a tree, and a tiny cap from a bit of dough.
What's wrong with these people?
What's the difference between a religion and a cult?
Pinocchio ran to look at himself in a bowl of water, and he felt so happy that he said proudly: "Now I look like a gentleman."
When poverty shows itself, even mischievous boys understand what it means.
"Where's your coat, Father?" "I have sold it." "Why did you sell your coat?" "It was too warm."
Pinocchio understood the answer and, unable to restrain his tears, he jumped on his father's neck and kissed him over and over.
As he walked along, his brain was busy planning hundreds of wonderful things, building hundreds of castles in the air.
Guess what I did last night.
Fathers are indeed good to their children!
Tomorrow I'll go to school. There's always plenty of time to go to school.
"What is that house?" Pinocchio asked a little boy near him. "Read the sign and you'll know." "I'd like to read, but somehow I can't today."
"I'll give you four pennies for your A-B-C book," said a ragpicker who stood by.
The curtain was up and the performance had started.
His beard was as black as pitch, and so long that it reached from his chin down to his feet.
His mouth was as wide as an oven, his teeth like yellow fangs, and his eyes, two glowing red coals.
In his huge, hairy hands, a long whip, made of green snakes and black cats' tails twisted together, swished through the air in a dangerous way.
Enough! Be quiet! I'll take care of you later.
As soon as the play was over, the Director went to the kitchen, where a fine big lamb was slowly turning on the spit. More wood was needed to finish cooking it.
Father, save me! I don't want to die! I don't want to die!
Fire Eater (this was really his name) was very ugly.
There is no mercy here, Pinocchio. I have spared you. Harlequin must burn in your place. I am hungry and my dinner must be cooked.
He had gone barely half a mile when he met a lame Fox and a blind Cat, walking together like two good friends. The lame Fox leaned on the Cat, and the blind Cat let the Fox lead him along.
"You, a rich man?" said the Fox, and he began to laugh out loud. The Cat was laughing also, but tried to hide it by stroking his long whiskers.
I want to go to school and study hard.
"Look at me," said the Fox. "For the silly reason of wanting to study, I have lost a paw." "Look at me," said the Cat. "For the same foolish reason, I have lost the sight of both eyes."
In the twinkling of an eyelid, the Cat leaped on the blackbird, and ate him, feathers and all.
"Poor blackbird!" said Pinocchio to the Cat. "Why did you kill him?"
I killed him to teach him a lesson. He talks too much. Next time he will keep his words to himself.
"Do you want to double your gold pieces?" "What do you mean?"
Instead of returning home, come with us.
Home is near, and I'm going where Father is waiting for me. How unhappy he must be that I have not yet returned! I have been a bad son, and the Talking Cricket was right when he said that a disobedient boy cannot be happy in this world.
Just outside the City of Simple Simons, there is a blessed field called the Field of Wonders.
Just outside the City of Catchfools, there is a blessed field called the Field of Wonders.
In this field you dig a hole and in the hole you bury a gold piece. After covering up the hole with earth you water it well, sprinkle a bit of salt on it, and go to bed. During the night, the gold piece sprouts, grows, blossoms, and next morning you find a beautiful tree, that is loaded with gold pieces.
"We do not work for gain," answered the Fox. "We work only to enrich others."
"What good people," thought Pinocchio to himself. And forgetting his father, the new coat, the A-B-C book, and all his good resolutions, he said to the Fox and to the Cat: "Let us go. I am with you."
"Let us stop here a while," said the Fox, "to eat a bite and rest for a few hours."
As soon as Pinocchio was in bed, he fell fast asleep and began to dream.
As he walked, Pinocchio noticed a tiny insect glimmering on the trunk of a tree, a small being that glowed with a pale, soft light.
"Who are you?" he asked. "I am the ghost of the Talking Cricket," answered the little being in a faint voice that sounded as if it came from a far-away world.
Return home and give the four gold pieces you have left to your poor old father who is weeping because he has not seen you for many a day.
Don't listen to those who promise you wealth overnight, my boy. As a rule they are either fools or swindlers! Listen to me and go home.
Remember that boys who insist on having their own way, sooner or later come to grief.
Once again the road was plunged in darkness.
I think assassins have been invented by fathers and mothers to frighten children who want to run away at night.
Your money or your life!
And after having killed you, we will kill your father also.
No, no, no, not my Father!
Quick as a flash, the marionette sank his teeth deep into the Assassin's hand, bit it off and spat it out.
His pursuers were after him at once, like two dogs chasing a hare.
At the noise, a window opened and a lovely maiden looked out.
She had azure hair and a face white as wax. Her eyes were closed and her hands crossed on her breast.
No one lives in this house. Everyone is dead.
"I also am dead." "Dead? What are you doing at the window, then?"
Pinocchio was made of very hard wood and the knives broke into a thousand pieces.
They tied Pinocchio's hands behind his shoulders and slipped the noose around his neck.
These were his last words. He closed his eyes, opened his mouth, stretched out his legs, and hung there, as if he were dead.
The word lends itself to misuse by beginners.
Tom rejects modern technology and lives like in the eighties.
The lovely maiden with azure hair was none other than a very kind fairy who had lived, for more than a thousand years, in the vicinity of the forest.
To my mind this marionette is dead and gone; but if, by any evil chance, he were not, then that would be a sure sign that he is still alive!
I am sorry," said the Owl, "to have to contradict the Crow, my famous friend and colleague. To my mind this Marionette is alive; but if, by any evil chance, he were not, then that would be a sure sign that he is wholly dead!"
I say that a wise doctor, when he does not know what he is talking about, should know enough to keep his mouth shut.
He is rude, lazy, a runaway.
Pinocchio hid his face under the sheets.
That Marionette is a disobedient son who is breaking his father's heart!
"When the dead weep, they are beginning to recover," said the Crow solemnly.
"I am sorry to contradict my famous friend and colleague," said the Owl, "but as far as I'm concerned, I think that when the dead weep, it means they do not want to die."
As soon as the three doctors had left the room, the Fairy went to Pinocchio's bed and, touching him on the forehead, noticed that he was burning with fever.
Drink this, and in a few days you'll be up and well.
"If it's bitter, I don't want it." "Drink it!" "I don't like anything bitter."
"Do you promise?" "Yes."
I won't drink this awful water. I won't. I won't! No, no, no, no!
"Aren't you afraid of death?" "Not a bit. I'd rather die than drink that awful medicine."
Give me that glass! Quick, please! I don't want to die!
As he spoke, his nose, long though it was, became at least two inches longer.
At this second lie, his nose grew a few more inches.
It's the best feeling.
Tom is a limo driver.
At this third lie, his nose became longer than ever, so long that he could not even turn around.
"Why do you laugh?" "I am laughing at your lies." "How do you know I'm lying?"
There are two kinds of lies, lies with short legs and lies with long noses. Yours, just now, happen to have long noses.
Crying as if his heart would break, the Marionette mourned for hours over the length of his nose.
The Fairy showed no pity toward him, as she was trying to teach him a good lesson, so that he would stop telling lies, the worst habit any boy may acquire.
A thousand woodpeckers flew in through the window and settled themselves on Pinocchio's nose. They pecked and pecked so hard at that enormous nose that in a few moments, it was the same size as before.
"I love you, too," answered the Fairy, "and if you wish to stay with me, you may be my little brother and I'll be your good little sister."
What an awful world to live in!
What an awful world we live in!
Then he ended by doing what all boys do, when they have no heart and little brain.
Dig a hole here and put the gold pieces into it.
I don't wanna hear another word about it.
I'll build myself a beautiful palace, with a thousand stables filled with a thousand wooden horses to play with, a cellar overflowing with lemonade and ice cream soda, and a library of candies and fruits, cakes and cookies.
More than baby sea turtles were released into the sea.
In the German Wikipedia there are people who are such sticklers for rules, that other contributors, often far more knowledgeable, take to their heels en masse.
The judge listened to him with great patience. A kind look shone in his eyes. He became very much interested in the story; he felt moved; he almost wept.
This poor simpleton has been robbed of four gold pieces. Take him, therefore, and throw him into prison.
It had rained for many days, and the road was so muddy that, at times, Pinocchio sank down almost to his knees.
I'm sad now.
I am certainly very stubborn and stupid!
From now on, I'll be different and I'll try to become a most obedient boy.
Hunger, my boy, is no reason for taking something which belongs to another.

The wagon was drawn by twelve pair of donkeys, all of the same size, but all of different color.
The wagon was so closely packed with boys of all ages that it looked like a box of sardines.
The thought that in a few hours they would reach a country where there were no schools, no books, no teachers, made these boys so happy that they felt neither hunger, nor thirst, nor sleep, nor discomfort.
Tell me, my fine boy, do you also want to come to my wonderful country?
I want to return home, as I prefer to study and to succeed in life.
The little fat man did not laugh.
This great land was entirely different from any other place in the world. Its population, large though it was, was composed wholly of boys. The oldest were about fourteen years of age, the youngest, eight.
Everywhere groups of boys were gathered together. Some played at marbles, at hopscotch, at ball. Others rode on bicycles or on wooden horses.
His manly figure was adorned and enriched by a beautiful pair of donkey's ears.

The applause grew to a roar when Pinocchio, the famous donkey, appeared in the circus ring.
There, in front of him, in a box sat a beautiful woman. Around her neck she wore a long gold chain, from which hung a large medallion.
The next morning the veterinary‚Äîthat is, the animal doctor‚Äîdeclared that he would be lame for the rest of his life.
His new owner took him to a high cliff overlooking the sea, put a stone around his neck, tied a rope to one of his hind feet, gave him a push, and threw him into the water.
I am going to take you to the market once more and sell you as dry firewood.
That sea monster was no other than the enormous shark, which has often been mentioned in this story and which, on account of its cruelty, had been nicknamed "The Attila of the Sea" by both fish and fishermen.
"But I don't want to be digested," shouted Pinocchio, starting to sob.
I am wise enough to think that if one is born a fish, it is more dignified to die under the water than in the frying pan.
"Are my eyes really telling me the truth?" answered the old man, rubbing his eyes. "Are you really my own dear Pinocchio?"
This candle you see here is the last one I have.
And in any case, if it is written that we must die, we shall at least die together.
Follow me and have no fear.

When bad boys become good and kind, they have the power of making their homes gay and new with happiness.
