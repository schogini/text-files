Why, of course, the people don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. [...] Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.

To give a person one's opinion and correct his faults is an important thing. It is compassionate and comes first in matters of service. But the way of doing this is extremely difficult. To discover the good and bad points of a person is an easy thing, and to give an opinion concerning them is easy, too. For the most part, people think that they are being kind by saying the things that others find distasteful or difficult to say. But if it is not received well, they think that there is nothing more to be done. This is completely worthless. It is the same as bringing shame to a person by slandering him. It is nothing more than getting it off one's chest.

Game of Thrones has been credited with an increased popularity of fantasy themes and mainstream acceptance of the fantasy fandom.
As liberty of thought is absolute, so is liberty of speech, which is "inseparable" from the liberty of thought.

Mary pulled the ironing board out of the closet and unfolded it, setting it up beside the window.
Mary thought to herself that she ought to buy a new cover for the ironing board since the old one was getting pretty tattered.
Mary took the iron off the shelf, unwrapped the electrical cord, plugged in the iron and chose a heat setting.
As the iron was heating up, Mary poured distilled water into the reservoir to make steam.
Always use distilled water in steam irons because using ordinary water will cause a mineral build-up over time that will clog the steam holes.
Use the highest heat settings only when you're ironing fabrics made of natural fibers like cotton or linen.
Using high heat settings while ironing synthetic fabrics will melt the synthetic fibers and cause visible permanent damage, which often looks like a shiny area where the too-hot iron had the longest contact with the fabric.
When she was finished ironing, Mary switched off the iron and unplugged it, then left it alone for a while to let it cool.
After the iron had cooled off, Mary wrapped the electrical cord around the iron, put the iron back on the shelf, folded up the ironing board, and put it away back in the closet.

My formidable grandmother was such a stickler for language that whenever she heard someone ask "Can I…" she would interrupt and snap back at them, "I don't know, can you? If you don't know yourself how would I know what you're capable of? If you're asking permission say 'May I…' "
