Where did you get that hat?
For a couple of years now I've believed that at all times I can be wrong about anything, including that belief.
Since my mind governs my thought or rather is my thought, I have no guarantee that I am more correct by realising something that has not only been made by the same mind as its user but also, the chance of my realising this belief is dictated by my mind, which is prone to opinion and hiding of facts.
This not only means that my theory is not entirely holeproof but also that I am no more or less wrong for thinking so or not.
Music is troublesome. It seems that no sooner have you created it, than it in some strange way fades its original spark that was glorified by your mind.

Intelligence is our ability to begin understanding (or adapting to) new information, regardless of past familiarity.
Intelligence tests are so fooled by study that they miss the most important aspect of human efficiency: the mind to think in ways contrary to those around them, which comes not from intelligence but from a path of thinking and from condition.
Learning a new language is like meeting someone for the first time who always claims you are wrong, and worse - has the ability to prove it.
