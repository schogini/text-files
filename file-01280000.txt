The World Health Organization said Thursday the deadly virus that prompted the Chinese government to lock down nearly million people in three cities has not developed into a worldwide health emergency.
The Chinese government isolated three cities Thursday, an unprecedented move to contain the virus, which has spread to several other countries.
Authorities first banned planes and trains from leaving the city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus is believed to have originated. Toll roads were closed, and ferry, subway and bus services were also suspended.
The cities were put on lockdown on the eve of the Lunar New Year, when millions of Chinese traditionally travel.
The government also canceled holiday events in Beijing that usually attract large crowds.
The virus has killed at least people, all in and around Wuhan, and infected nearly others.

A judge in bankruptcy court has ruled in favor of a law school graduate who asked to have more than $220,in student debt erased.
The case is notable because student debt is commonly thought to be unforgivable in bankruptcy cases, a lament of many students who leave college saying they are too financially burdened to advance the milestones of adulthood, like buying property or having children.
Borrower Kevin J. Rosenberg, 46, of Beacon, N.Y., asked the court to forgive his student debt because repaying the loans was impossible and created an undue hardship, the legal test of whether a debtor should be forgiven.
Rosenberg’s student debt commenced in 1993, when he enrolled as an undergraduate at the University of Arizona, according to court documents.
After receiving a bachelor’s degree in history, he served in the U.S. Navy on active duty for five years.
He attended Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York from to 2004.
Tom's degree was financed by student loans.
When he graduated from law school in April 2005, he consolidated his debts with a nonprofit corporation called Educational Credit Management Corp., (ECMC), owing $116,in principle on the loan amount before interest.
The average loan debt for law school graduates in was between $84,and $122,158, according to the American Bar Association.
Almost 70% of law school graduates in left with student debt, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
Shortly after starting his first job as an associate attorney at a law firm, Rosenberg decided that practicing law was not for him, because he disliked working in an office and did not find the work interesting.
I realized the whole job is sitting in the office by yourself.
Rosenberg was relieved of his debt.
Tom was relieved of his debt.
"A lot more people should be filing and trying to prove undue hardship, because they would be successful if they actually came before a judge,” Iuliano advised.
"People are really struggling under this debt for a very long time. Your repayment term is to years, and that’s as long as some people’s mortgages," she said.
Many top private U.S. universities have what’s called legacy admissions, meaning applicants whose parents or family members went to that school get preference over others.
But is it fair?
Many educators and admissions officers are questioning whether legacy admissions should be abandoned. Others say the practice helps raise funds that can be used for students who need financial aid.
Many educators and admissions officers are questioning whether legacy admissions should be abandoned.
At Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, legacy admissions were ended recently. JHU President Ronald J. Daniels said that many children of Hopkins’ graduates already have social and educational advantages.
Most colleges and universities continue the practice.
Schools that allow legacy admissions say they raise more money if they give children of alumni special consideration.
The Twitterverse is overwhelmingly in favor of abolishing legacy admissions at U.S. colleges and universities.

Imagine you're riding public transport to school or work and the man across the aisle erupts in a sneeze that explodes into the air. Halfway down the car, someone else coughs uncontrollably. Neither cover their mouth or nose.
The incubation period can take up to two weeks.
Tom is wearing a surgical mask.
Viruses typically ride on aerosolized droplets, meaning the stuff that comes out of your nose and mouth when you cough and sneeze.
The U.S. government warns that masks do not "filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes or certain medical procedures."
Masks can’t prevent droplets from getting into your eyes.
Social media has been sharing hashtag #coveryourmouth, admonishing people to use the crook of their arm, a handkerchief or a tissue to block the spew of aerosolized germs in public places.
Handwashing (include the wrists and lower arms, health officials say) and disinfecting are key to preventing the virus from spreading.
Wash your hands frequently.
Cover your mouth when sneezing or coughing and then wash your hands.
Use a face mask if you have cough.
While surgical masks are not so unusual in Asian countries, they are conspicuous in Western ones where people might be reticent to use them.
Frequent traveler Francesca Domenella said, at her father's urging, she started wearing a surgical mask after returning from China.
The Italian aerospace engineer, working as a risk engineer for a global commercial insurance company, found a mask in a stylish black that is washable.
"In Europe, surgical masks are not common so I was expecting people to give me weird looks, which they do as soon as they realize I am not Asian," Domenella, who was traveling through Germany on her way to London, told VOA in an email.
The populations most at risk of contracting the virus are the elderly, the very young and those with compromised immune systems.
Milton said the college-age population of healthy young adults is less likely to get sick.
Sports fans around the world are struggling to find words to describe how they feel about the sudden death of retired U.S. basketball legend Kobe Bryant.
Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna were among nine killed Sunday in a helicopter crash in the hills outside Los Angeles.
Bryant was known to use a helicopter from his home to games in Los Angeles to avoid the city's notoriously bad traffic.
The Los Angeles County sheriff's department says the investigation is ongoing.
Bryant has gone down in history as one of the greatest professional basketball players ever to step onto the court.
Bryant spent his entire pro career with the Los Angeles Lakers -- winning five NBA championships and the league's Most Valuable Player award in 2008.
Bryant is the fourth all-time leading scorer.
A native of Philadelphia, Bryant spent much of his youth in Italy where his father played pro basketball after his own career in the NBA.
His poem in which he bade farewell to the Lakers, “Dear Basketball,” was turned into an animated cartoon.

NASA's Kepler spacecraft was designed to find exoplanets by looking for stars that dim as a planet crosses the star's face.
In a generic brick building on the northwestern edge of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center campus in Greenbelt, Maryland, thousands of computers packed in racks the size of vending machines hum in a deafening chorus of data crunching.
These machines collectively are known as NASA’s Discover supercomputer and they are tasked with running sophisticated climate models to predict Earth’s future climate.
Science fiction often imagines our future on Mars and other planets as run by machines, with metallic cities and flying cars rising above dunes of red sand.
Instead of habitats made of metal and glass, NASA is exploring technologies that could grow structures out of fungi to become our future homes in the stars, and perhaps lead to more sustainable ways of living on Earth as well.
The myco-architecture project out of NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley is prototyping technologies that could "grow" habitats on the Moon, Mars and beyond out of life – specifically, fungi and the unseen underground threads that make up the main part of the fungus, known as mycelia.
The project envisions a future where human explorers can bring a compact habitat built out of a lightweight material with dormant fungi that will last on long journeys to places like Mars. Upon arrival, by unfolding that basic structure and simply adding water, the fungi will be able to grow around that framework into a fully functional human habitat – all while being safely contained within the habitat to avoid contaminating the Martian environment.
A fungus is a group of organisms that produces spores and eats up organic material, like the yeasts in bread or beer, the mushrooms in your salad, the mold that may grow if you let that salad sit in the refrigerator for too long or even the organisms that produce antibiotics like penicillin.

There are protests in France.
The European Parliament gave the green light for Britain’s departure from the European Union.
The vote was overwhelming, to 49, but it was an emotional departure.
After being part of some sort of a European union for nearly half a century, it took only a few seconds for Britain to see its departure overwhelmingly approved by the European Parliament.
The next step promises to be difficult, as Britain negotiates its future relationship the EU, especially on trade matters.
The EU will not be the same without you.
“To all of you, I will say that I will miss you,” a French lawmaker said. “The EU will not be the same without you. My deep feeling is there is no good Brexit.”
“If the British people ever decide to come back, our arms will be open,” a Spanish lawmaker said.
Britain’s last day as an EU member is Friday.
The British flag will be lowered at EU institutions.
Many Europeans are not paying much attention to this latest chapter of the very long process popularly known as "Brexit."
With a shrug and some sorrow, Europeans bid 'Adieu' to EU member Britain.
After three and-a-half years of tortuous negotiations and political chaos, Britain will officially leave the European Union at o’clock in the evening London time Friday.
Pro-Brexit supporters are planning celebrations.

After three-and-a-half years of tortuous negotiations and political chaos that forced the resignation of two prime ministers, Britain will officially leave the European Union at 11:p.m. London time Friday.
Members of the European Parliament sang and held hands after a vote on the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
Pro-Brexit supporters are planning celebrations in central London and elsewhere across the country, while pro-EU marches also are expected in the capital.
Members of the European Parliament joined hands to sing "Auld Lang Syne" at the end of the session Wednesday in Brussels, a friendly farewell to their British counterparts, after having voted through the terms of Britain's departure from the EU under the Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration.
We are waiting for Santa.
Members of the European Parliament joined hands to sing "Auld Lang Syne" at the end of the session Wednesday in Brussels.
Tom and Mary sang "Auld Lang Syne".
Pro-Brexit British members of the European Parliament celebrated as they headed home.
“We're leaving. Freedom, democracy, to self-governance, we've won!” declared Brexit party member of Parliament (MEP) Nigel Farage.
For others, there was sadness and regret. “Everybody will miss the British representatives,” said Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt. “Not all British representatives — for example, I don't think we will miss Mr. Farage. But all the others — yes.”
The continuing uncertainty during those negotiations will cost Britain $5.billion in lost GDP this year alone, according to a RAND Corporation report, increasing to $13.billion if the negotiations continue to 2025.
Early indications suggest Europe will demand access to British fishing waters and guarantees that Britain won’t undercut the EU’s labor and environmental standards, in return for access to the EU Single Market.
Meanwhile, the United Kingdom itself is coming under increasing strain, with Scotland’s devolved government in Edinburgh demanding a vote on independence so it can try to re-join the European Union.
Boris Johnson so far has refused permission for Scotland to hold another independence referendum following the last such vote in 2014.

Brexiters are exulting and in a celebratory mood.
“I fluctuate between wanting to mark Brexit quietly but symbolically with some friends in Berlin, or just staying home with my husband and going across the road to our local bar for a couple of strong cocktails. Or maybe just going to bed and hiding under the duvet. Whatever I end up doing, the mood deep down will be sadness,” she said.
For the past four years British expats had been riding an emotional rollercoaster as the long Brexit saga played out.
For British pensioners living in Europe, the anxiety has been compounded by watching the purchasing power of the pound weaken as sterling fell in value after the Brexit vote.
“As a couple living in Italy for years, and retiring on UK-earned pensions prior to the referendum, we have lost nearly percent of our annual income due to the devaluation of sterling since UK citizens voted for Brexit in June 2016,” says Donald Law, a retired British doctor living in Pisa, Italy.
Many of the British in Europe were disenfranchised in 2016, barred from voting in the Brexit referendum because of British electoral law, which strips voting rights from anyone who has been living overseas for more than years.
Expats say they have felt abandoned by Britain and complain British ministers paid them little attention.
As with the estimated million EU citizens living in Britain, British expats will have to reapply to their host countries for confirmation of their residency rights. This should prove just a formality, and unlike British authorities when it comes to processing EU citizens in Britain, EU countries aren’t planning to exact a fee.
A host of other practical issues remain unresolved, including whether professional and academic qualifications held by Britons will be recognized in the EU.
EU nationals have the right to vote and stand in municipal elections where they live, even if they're not citizens of that country, under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty, which established the EU.
In the German village of Brunsmark, Brexit is forcing Scotsman Iain Macnab to cut short his third term as mayor.
